SPECIES AT RISK AND SPECIES OF 
MANAGEMENT CONCERN 

The assessment of wildlife and wildlife habitat for the Project components (i.e., the Turner Valley, 
Longview and Lundbreck Sections) is based on wildlife species at risk and species of management 
concern because collectively they are legislatively protected, important for socio-economic or traditional 
use, associated with habitat features that have been observed in the LAAs, sensitive to anthropogenic 
changes in habitat, or are often used as indicators of ecosystem health. To focus the assessment, 
representative key indicators were selected from species at risk that have potential to be directly or 
indirectly affected by Project activities based on the species’ ranges, habitat availability, and baseline 
wildlife data collected for the Project. 

Species at risk are considered those: 

• listed on Schedule 1 of Species at Risk Act (SARA) as endangered, threatened, or special concern 
(GOC 2020), or 

• listed under the Alberta Wildlife Act as endangered or threatened (GOA 2017) 

There are 20 wildlife species at risk with potential to interact with Turner Valley Section, 21 wildlife 
species at risk with potential to interact with the Longview Section and 22 wildlife species at risk with the 
potential to interact with the Lundbreck Section. Table F.1 provides a list of species at risk with potential 
to interact with the Project, their status, applicable federal and provincial recovery plans, action plans 
and/or management plans, and an assessment of interaction (i.e., Yes or No) between the pipeline 
sections and each species.  

Table F.2 provides a description of the Project’s predicted interactions or justification for lack of 
interactions with the identified species at risk. Table F.2 also describes predicted residual Project effects 
following the implementation of mitigation measures, lists proposed mitigation measures to avoid or 
reduce residual project effects on species at risk, and outlines how mitigation measures align with 
applicable ECCC’s recovery strategies, action plans or management plans (if applicable).
