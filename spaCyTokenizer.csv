177,"Relevant circumstances noted by Campus included: depressed gas markets, declining volumes, very small shipper base, the potential end of the long-term contracts and associated volumes, declining credit quality of potential shippers, and an aging pipeline that will require further integrity management and incremental operating, maintenance and capital expenditures as it gets closer to the end of its service.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
178,"Campus indicated that there was shipper support for the proposed tolls as it held discussions with several interested shippers, and a contract was executed with GEX Resources subscribing for a five-year term of firm-service.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878

185,Campus also introduced a new two-year firm and new IT service to address the producer desire for shorter and more flexible options.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878

195,10 of 32 Campus submitted these are all relevant factors in favour of maintaining market-based tolling for the Pipeline.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
196,Campus went on to argue that its tolls compare favourably with NGTL tolls.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
197,It said it has been established in this hearing that it is in a low load factor environment and shippers under the previous interruptible service tolls were not incentivized to subscribe to firm service.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
198,Campus said it was not necessary to consider cost of service information with respect to its tolls since each tolling method must be considered on its own merit.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
199,Campus submitted that cost of service regulation at this stage in the life of the Suffield System would be inappropriate.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
200,It would undo the sharing of commercial risk that the NEB found appropriate in GH-2-98 and GH-2-2000 and potentially result in a transfer of the risk of asset underutilization and stranded costs to shippers in the current market.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
201,"In response to the issue of cost of service methodology, Campus went on to note that the Pipeline has never operated as a cost of service pipeline.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
202,"As such, there was never an approved rate base, capital structure, or return on rate base for the pipeline; and cost of service information was never tracked for the Pipeline because it was never necessary.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
203,"Campus did not track the book value or net book value of the Pipeline separately from the total value of the Property, Plant and Equipment recorded in Campus’ financial statements.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
204,Campus therefore had to estimate certain information used in the Illustrative Cost of service Toll Model.  ,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
205,Campus submitted that changing the toll structure on the Pipeline to a cost of service regime would shorten the economic life of the pipeline.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
206,Campus said that cost of service tolls would be uncompetitive in the market and it would therefore not be able to attract new volumes to the system.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
207,"If the pipeline transitioned to a cost of service basis it would have to charge very high tolls on declining throughput, which would shorten the pipeline’s estimated remaining economic life to match the ten years of reserves left of its remaining firm shipper.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
208,Campus calculated a unit cost of service estimate of $0.392/GJ (which includes an abandonment surcharge of $0.082/GJ) for 2020 based on the estimates and assumptions that it provided.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878

226,"Campus provided a comparison to other gas transportation and distribution utilities, indicating that the risk profiles of the comparable pipelines were substantially lower than Campus’ and would support higher leverage ratios.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
227,"Campus submitted the Complainants’ deemed 60-40 debt-to-equity ratio should be given no weight, given the lack of similarity in risk profiles to the Complainants’ comparators in relation to risk, credit ratings, size and other factors.

232,Campus submitted that the current underutilization of the Pipeline presents several challenges.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
233,"Interruptible service is effectively just as reliable as firm service, because of the Pipeline’s excess unused capacity.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878

244,"In the absence of negotiated market-based tolls, the Complainants argued in favour of a cost of service tolling method being imposed on Campus.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
245,"The Complainants argued in the alternative that the most appropriate market-based tolls the Commission could impose would be those in the Complainants' TSAs with AltaGas, which had commercial support and were not challenged by any shippers or prospective shippers on the Pipeline.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878

250,The Complainants asserted that the original proponent of the Pipeline was to be regulated on a complaint basis as a Group 2 company.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
251,"Prior acceptance by the NEB of a ""market-based"" toll methodology for a pipeline at a point in time does not insulate new tolls, or the tolling methodology, on the Pipeline from the Commission’s review or the statutory requirement that such tolls be just and reasonable.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
252,"If the Commission were not able to review new tolls, or the tolling methodology on a pipeline, this would undermine the complaint-based regulation of Group 2 companies and enable pipeline companies to routinely earn amounts well in excess of a fair rate of return, without oversight from the Commission.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
253,The Complainants said that having cost of service information was essential to complaint based regulation.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
254,The Complainants said both the NEB and Commission have long required costs of service information listed in Guide P of the Filing Manual to be provided when there is a complaint against a Group 2 Company.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
255,"In the view of the Complainants, without this requirement, a regulator could not satisfy itself that the primary toll principal of cost causation was satisfied.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878

257,The Complainants stated that Campus cancelled their TSAs in order to dramatically increase tolls and impose more onerous shipper terms and conditions.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
258,This was done despite the fact that the former TSAs have a 15 month notice clause for any toll changes and the representation in the transfer application that there were no immediate plans to alter the tolls or conditions of service.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
259,"The Complainants submitted that Campus exerted its market power to force them off the Pipeline unless and until they agreed to higher tolls and more onerous terms than had existed in the contracts executed with the prior owner, AltaGas.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
260,"If the proposed tolls are accepted it is likely that Rockpoint and Pine Cliff would continue not to utilize the Pipeline, and Torxen would look to remove or reduce its volumes transported on the Pipeline.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878

274,"The Complainants indicated that as the Pipeline has a greater available capacity than the South Suffield pipeline, but the South line has a greater proportion of volume shipped, Campus’ methodology results in the subsidization of costs of the South Suffield pipeline by the Pipeline.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
275,The Complainants submitted that allocating these costs based on relative actual use results in a fairer allocation of costs than based on capacity between the North and South Suffield pipelines.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878

524,4.2 Interim IT tolls Views of Campus,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
525,"On 27 June 2019, the NEB ordered that the Pipeline’s tolls be made interim effective 1 July 2019.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
526,Campus requested an Order from the Commission directing shippers who have received new firm or interruptible service on the Pipeline since 1 July 2019 to pay to Campus the difference between the interim tolls and the tolls payable under the Revised Tolls and Tariff for the interim period.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
527,"Campus also requested the discretion to post a revised IT toll from time to time based on Campus’s assessment of prevailing market conditions, in an amount equal to or less than the IT toll proposed in the Revised Toll and Tariff.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
528,Campus also submitted that it removed the Annual Increase of Tolls and Charges notice because it desires the flexibility to adjust its IT tolls on a monthly basis in response to prevailing market conditions.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
529,Campus submitted an illustrative monthly market-based Suffield System toll calculation to illustrate how it could use its discretion to decrease the IT toll in response to market conditions.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
530,"Specifically, Campus showed the receipt and delivery tolls on NGTL along with the Empress transport day ahead index which is a secondary market that provides transportation from NIT to Empress and therefore competes with the Pipeline.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
531,"Campus submitted that from July 2019 through November 2020 it would have hypothetically set IT tolls at $0.32/GJ for three months; at $0.18, $0.20 and $0.15/GJ for one month each; at $0.13/GJ for five months; and at $0.12/GJ for six months.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
532,Campus clarified that it was not requesting the Commission impose tolls on the interim period consistent with these illustrative tolls.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
533,"However, Campus noted the Commission has the authority to have reference to the entirety of the evidence on the record in determining the relief to be granted.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
534,"In oral argument, Campus stated that it never had discretion to change tolls over the period covered in the illustrative example.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
535,It stated that it relies on Appendix A of its application for relief in respect of interim tolls.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
536,The IT toll listed in Appendix A is $0.32/GJ.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
537,Views of the Complainants,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
538,The Complainants submitted that their calculated cost of service tolls are just and reasonable and are reflective of Campus' cost of service during the interim period and prospectively.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
539,The Complainants requested these tolls should be made final for the interim period.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
540,The Complainants submitted that Campus' behaviour throughout the proceeding delayed the setting of final tolls.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
541,The Complainants were also concerned that Campus circumvented the 15-month advance notice requirement of any toll increase set out in the then-existing contracts and made misrepresentations to the NEB at the time of the transfer application.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
542,"The Complainants submitted that in these circumstances, Campus should not be permitted to benefit from its misconduct in the finalization of interim tolls, and that any increases should only operate prospectively.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
543,"The Complainants also submitted that because Campus' actions resulted in reduction in use of the Pipeline, Campus should be required to return carrying costs during the interim period.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
544,The Complainants submitted that refunds and carrying costs should be calculated for the interim period and provided to shippers.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
545,"In the alternative, the Complainants request that the Commission set the tolls for a period of 15 months from the date of the Commission's toll order, which is equivalent to the toll change notice period that  Letter Decision Page 24 of 32",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878

548,"Views of the Commission Given that the Commission made an interim order regarding tolls, pursuant to section 232 of the CER Act, the Commission may make an order directing the pipeline company to refund or recover tolls in the manner the Commission deems to be appropriate.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
549,"Typically if the final tolls found to be just and reasonable are higher than the toll set in the interim toll order there would be a recovery, and if final tolls are lower there would be a refund.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
550,"The Commission has not approved Campus’ or the Complainants’ proposed tolls, but has instead approved a range of IT rates which may be set at $0.32/GJ or less based on market conditions.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
551,This discretion was approved along with an alternative to contract for FT service on reasonable terms with just and reasonable tolls.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
552,"When Campus proposed an IT toll of $0.32/GJ and tolls were made interim, the Complainants stopped moving IT volumes through contracts with Campus to the extent possible, even despite some recent capital investments to connect to the Suffield System.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
553,The Complainants were also unwilling to contract for FT service at the toll level and terms proposed by Campus.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
554,"The Commission expects that if Campus had been granted pricing discretion with a range of $0.32/GJ or less during this time period, Campus would have adjusted its IT tolls to meet the market and attract additional throughput to its pipeline.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
555,"It is possible that Campus would have kept its IT tolls at the maximum of $0.32/GJ even as throughput continued to decline and IT traffic dwindled, but this would have been inconsistent with Campus’ submissions that it is competing with the NGTL pipeline system.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
556,"The Complainants may have elected to contract for FT service if the tolls were in the range approved by the Commission in this decision, along with reasonable terms and conditions.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
557,"However, this alternative was not available to the Complainants during the interim toll period.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878

559,The interim toll for IT service was $0.1815/GJ.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
560,"Without knowing the market-responsive IT tolls that would have been set in the interim period, the Commission finds it impossible to calculate refunds or recoveries.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
561,"The Commission notes that over the interim toll period, the simple average of the illustrative IT tolls provided by Campus is $0.168 cents.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
562,The interim toll of $0.1815/GJ is slightly higher than the simple average of the illustrative tolls filed by Campus and is in the approved range of IT tolls of $0.32/GJ or less.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
563,"Factoring in all this information and in considering that Campus had the overall onus to support its position on this issue, the Commission makes the interim IT tolls final for the period of 1 July 2019 to 30 April 2021.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
564,The end result is that Campus did not meet its onus with respect to its request for an interim toll refund.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878

572,5.1 Billing date Views of Campus Campus proposed to change the billing date in Article 7.2(a) of its general terms and conditions.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
573,"Instead of billing on or before the 20th of each month, Campus proposes to bill “on or before the Day succeeding the Alberta Energy Regulator Volumetric Data and Waste Management Reporting Deadline of each Month” (the “AER reporting date”).",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
574,Campus submitted that the AER reporting date is an industry standard date well known to current and prospective Suffield System shippers.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
575,"Tethering the billing date to the AER reporting date ensures that Campus’ billing cycle will be in line with other important industry dates, and will automatically adjust if the AER reporting date is changed in the future.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878

581,"In its 5 June 2019 revised toll filing with the NEB, Campus proposed to collect a $0.02 abandonment fee in addition to its revised tolls.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
582,"On 20 September 2019, Campus filed further revised firm service tolls that no longer included any abandonment fee.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
583,Campus also no longer intended to collect the proposed abandonment fee on IT service.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
584,"Campus submitted that it is self-funding the abandonment liabilities for the Suffield System, which obligation is secured by a surety bond posted with the CER.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
585,Views of the Complainants Rockpoint originally objected to the $0.02 abandonment fee proposed by Campus in its 5 June 2019 toll filing on the basis that the surety bond in place already covered abandonment costs.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
586,"Further, Rockpoint said Campus had not obtained approval from the NEB to charge an abandonment fee, or otherwise provided information to shippers to explain the abandonment fee.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
587,Campus also proposed to increase the abandonment fee each year to account for inflation.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
588,"Rockpoint had concerns with this since abandonment obligations are calculated on a net present value-basis and, per MH-001-201335, all abandonment surcharges collected from shippers must be put into a trust that is expected to earn a certain return which would be realized by the trust.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878

630,5.4 Interruptible Preferred Service  Views of Campus Campus introduced ITp which has priority over regular IT service but not firm service volumes.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
631,Campus introduced ITp in response to shipper feedback requesting firm service that includes flexibility while still incorporating priority of service.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878

637,"In turn, this would provide the potential for longer-term throughput stability and revenue for the system.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
638,Campus submitted that any volumes shipped through ITp service result in a cost savings to firm service shippers relative to the IT tolls they would otherwise incur to ship such volumes and the difference in pricing is associated with the term commitment of firm service shippers compared to the lack thereof for interruptible service shippers.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878

647,"In the Complainants' view, Campus did not justify the need to offer ITp service and should not be permitted to do so.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
648,Views of the Commission,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
649,The Commission encourages its regulated companies to consult with interested parties and explore innovative ways to find market solutions.36 The Commission has taken into consideration that FT throughput on the Pipeline has been declining and encourages Campus’ attempts to respond to shipper feedback and introduce flexible new services.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
650,The Commission accepts Campus’ assertion that ITp service features provide firm service shippers with greater operational flexibility and may incent shippers to subscribe for firm service.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
651,"Accordingly, the Commission approves ITp service on the Pipeline at an amount corresponding with the shipper’s FT service toll plus $0.02.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
652,"Campus focused on the commitment required by shippers in the form of FT service contracts, with longer contract terms required to obtain greater portions of ITp service.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
653,Campus also noted that ITp being a feature of FT contracts makes FT contracts more desirable.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
654,The Commission finds that these factors support ITp having a lower price than IT service.                                                 ,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878

657,"North Montney Mainline Variance GC-125, May 2018 at 41.  ",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
658,Letter Decision Page 29 of 32,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
659,The Complainants focused on the higher priority of this service and submitted that ITp should therefore be charged at a higher amount compared to IT service.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
660,The Commission finds that the Complainants’ position fails to sufficiently account for the commitment required in order to qualify for ITp service.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
661,"Although Campus stated that ITp would be priced at an amount lower than the IT service toll, this may not always be the case, as the Commission has given Campus the discretion to lower the IT toll when market conditions warrant.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
662,The Commission notes that shippers with FT service would have the choice of using IT service or ITp service in circumstances where the IT tolls may be lower than the corresponding ITp toll.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
663,5.5 Failure of Supply and Market Views of Campus Campus amended the general terms and conditions regarding the price at which the transporter will sell gas to or buy gas from the customer in the event of a discrepancy between a customer’s receipts and deliveries on the system.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
664,"Given that shippers are the most knowledgeable about their gas supply and downstream demand, and given that the customer has the obligation to balance its quantity of gas, Campus believes it is reasonable for shippers to bear the risk of their receipt and delivery volumes falling out of balance.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
665,"Previously, Article 5.4 of the general terms and conditions stated the transporter could charge the customer “130% of [transporter’s] highest cost of gas on that day” if the customer’s deliveries on the system exceeded its receipts.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
666,Now Article 5.4 provides that the customer will be charged “the highest price transacted at the AECO/NIT index published by CGPR plus the higher of the Empress transportation tariff published by TCPL and the Empress – AECO/NIT market differential published by CGPR on that Day…” to balance the customer’s account.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
667,Article 5.5 of the general terms and conditions previously provided that the transporter could purchase gas from the customer at “seventy (70%) percent of [transporter’s] lowest purchase of gas on that day” if the customer’s receipts exceed its deliveries on the system.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
668,Now Article 5.5 provides that the transporter “will purchase from the customer at the lowest price transacted at the AECO/NIT index published by CGPR less the lower of the Empress transportation tariff published by TCPL and the Empress – AECO/NIT market differential published by CGPR on that Day…” to balance the customer’s account.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
669,"Campus submitted that specifying the AECO/NIT index as the benchmark for the gas price is reasonable, based on a readily identifiable market price and provides added clarity for both Campus and its shippers.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
670,The Empress tariff or differential is representative of downstream markets that Campus’ shippers have access to using the Suffield System.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
671,Views of the Complainants,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
672,The Complainants submitted that the proposed pricing mechanisms appear to heavily favour the transporter and may be considered punitive.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
673,This represents a significant and unwarranted shift in risk to the shipper.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
674,"Further, the articles of the general terms and conditions do not clearly contemplate or outline the interplay between upstream/downstream force majeure events on interconnected pipelines that may impact supply or delivery on the system and that are beyond the control of the shipper.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
675,"If no relief is provided to a shipper in such cases, while the transporter is insulated from associated risks pursuant to Article 5.7, there may arise an unreasonable imbalance in the TSA.  ",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
676,Letter Decision Page 30 of 32,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
677,"The Complainants requested that the pricing mechanisms in Articles 5.4 and 5.5 from the AltaGas TSA be reinserted, and that Campus include language to clarify the nature of the obligations where there are upstream/downstream force majeure events on interconnected pipelines.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
678,"The Complainants submitted they are concerned that Campus is proposing to ensure that shippers assume the total risk of supply or market failures, and that Campus is completely insulated from such risks.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
679,"The Complainants’ position is not that Campus assume all risks of such force majeure events, but that a sharing of those risks between the carrier and shippers would be just and reasonable.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
680,This is particularly the case where the pricing mechanisms in Articles 5.4 and 5.5 heavily favour Campus and are punitive to a shipper.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
681,Views of the Commission,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
682,The Commission does not approve the proposed changes to the wording in Articles 5.4 and 5.5 of the TSA and instructs Campus to revert to the previous provisions.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
683,The Commission acknowledges that it is reasonable for shippers to bear the risk of their receipt and delivery volumes falling out of balance as they are the ones who tender volumes and determine the receipt and delivery points for their tendered gas.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
684,"Where a shipper fails to ensure this balance, it is reasonable for the pipeline to be compensated for the costs of the actions it must take to ensure its pipeline system continues to operate within normal parameters.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
685,It may also be appropriate for these provisions to provide a disincentive for this behavior.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
686,"However, Campus did not provide any evidence that failure of supply or market has become problematic, nor that greater disincentives are required.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
687,The Commission agrees with the Complainants that upstream/downstream force majeure events on interconnected pipelines may impact supply or delivery on the system and are beyond the control of the shipper.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
688,This should not create an opportunity for the pipeline to earn excessive profits.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
689,The Commission notes that the previous provisions contained a 30 per cent premium on the cost of gas purchased in the event of failure of supply and a 30 per cent discount on the cost of gas in the event of failure of market.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
690,"In both cases these costs were related to gas that was actually purchased by the transporter, whereas the proposed provisions seek to link the costs to the most extreme (highest or lowest priced) transactions on the AECO/NIT index.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
691,Campus did not provide any evidence of how these extreme transactions are relevant to the costs actually incurred by the Pipeline to balance its receipts and deliveries or otherwise provide appropriate justification for the proposed changes.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
692,"5.6 Testing of Measuring Equipment Views of Campus Campus revised Article 4.3 of its general terms and conditions to require that the shipper, rather than the transporter, bear the costs of conducting standardized testing to ensure the accuracy of measurement equipment at the shipper’s receipt and delivery points.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
693,Campus submitted that it implemented this change because many Suffield System shippers own the measurement equipment at their receipt points and it is reasonable for shippers to bear the costs of ensuring the accuracy of their own measurement equipment.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
694,"For shippers relying on Campus’ measurement equipment, Campus believes requiring these shippers to pay for periodic testing is reasonable compared to the alternative of Campus requiring such shippers to install and maintain their own measurement equipment.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
695,"Under a market-based toll regime where Campus is not assured the recovery of its invested capital or costs of operation,  Letter Decision Page 31 of 32 Campus believes it should be permitted to enter into commercial arrangements with its shippers that allocate costs and risks as mutually agreed.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
696,Campus explained that its approval of tests and methods is required to ensure consistency across the transmission system and ensure the standards meet regulatory requirements.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
697,"Given the tests and methods for verifying the accuracy of measuring equipment previously required transporter approval, this change was made to simplify the agreement.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
698,The shipper still has the right to exceed the transporter’s requirements to meet their own should they so choose.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
699,Campus does not believe there has been a material shift in risk to the shippers as a result of this change.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
700,Campus stated that it maintains and completes much of the calibration and testing on the legacy devices at receipt points but has been shifting the responsibility with many of the new tie-ins to the customer given they already have and maintain meters.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
701,This was done to keep the tie-in and ongoing maintenance costs as low as possible.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
702,Campus also submitted that the change in frequency from three months to 90 days was not material and there is a provision to change this upon the reasonable request of either party.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
703,"Campus estimated that the cost for instrumentation, testing and analysis would be $78,000.00 for 2020 for the entire Suffield System and these costs were included in Campus’ illustrative cost of service tolls.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
704,Views of the Complainants,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
705,"The Complainants observed that with the proposed change, the expense of testing measuring equipment has been moved from the transporter to the shipper in all cases.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
706,The Complainants submitted that the fact that some shippers may own the measuring equipment does not justify the proposed shift of costs.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
707,The Complainants requested that Campus revert to the language from the AltaGas TSA in Article 4.3.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
708,"Pursuant to the change, the shipper will be responsible for the costs of all tests of measuring equipment, regardless of whether such tests are requested by the shipper.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
709,"Under the AltaGas TSA, the transporter bore the costs of tests of measuring equipment, except where a shipper-requested test showed an inaccuracy of less than two per cent (in which case, it was the shipper’s expense).",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
710,"The Complainants submitted that this is appropriate, as the transporter should be expected to pay the expense of ensuring the integrity of its system, including in relation to measurement of gas, while still holding a shipper accountable if a potentially unnecessary test has been requested.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
711,Views of the Commission,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
712,The Commission generally accepts Campus’ position that it should be permitted to enter into commercial arrangements with its shippers that allocate costs and risks as mutually agreed.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
713,"The Commission notes that the Complainants, who were all shippers, do not agree to this shifting of costs.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
714,"Campus did not provide evidence of the proportion of measuring equipment owned by Campus versus its shippers, the proportion of the costs of testing that is currently paid for by Campus versus its shippers, nor data on how these arrangements have changed over time.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
715,"As discussed in section 4.1, shippers on the Pipeline have already constructed interconnecting equipment.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
716,"In the interest of transparency and regulatory certainty, the Commission would not approve a change to an existing commercial agreement in the absence of compelling evidence.",https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
717,Campus did not provide evidence of why its proposed change would result in a better outcome.,https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4099878
