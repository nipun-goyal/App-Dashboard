NEB Tariff No. 18 is being filed as an IJT between Keystone, and in agreement with, TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, LP, by its general partner, TransCanada Keystone Pipeline GP, LLC as offering joint international service from Hardisty, Alberta, Canada to Port Arthur, Texas in the United States (U.S.). As per Keystone’s proposal to discount uncommitted tolls (accepted by the Board in OH-1-2007 and OH-1-2008), the IJT will provide a more competitive and transparent full path toll to further attract uncommitted volumes to the U.S. Gulf Coast via the Keystone Pipeline System. The IJT rates set forth in NEB Tariff No. 18 are less than the sum of the local tariff rates for the component movements on the Keystone Pipeline System and the Keystone U.S. Pipeline System. As evidenced in Appendix A the proposed IJT rates would result in a discount to the sum of the local tariff rates.3 The proposed IJT does not affect any other posted rate, toll or charge payable in accordance with local tariffs. The tariffs for the local rates in the U.S. are filed with the 1 NEB Reasons for Decision, TransCanada Keystone Pipeline GP Ltd., Application for Construction and Operation of the Keystone Pipeline, September 2007 (OH-1-2007). 2 NEB Reasons for Decision, TransCanada Keystone Pipeline GP Ltd., Facilities and Toll Methodology, July 2008 (OH-1-2008). 3 Table 1 and Table 2 assume an exchange rate of CAD $1.00 = US $0.71. Additional tables included for illustrative purposes assume the Canadian dollar to be at par with the U.S. dollar, which scenario also results in the IJT rates being less than the sum of the local tariff rates.

(Enbridge)  Canadian Mainline Contracting Application Hearing Order RH-001-2020 Procedural Update No. 5 – Updated hearing timetable  On 10 May 2021, the Commission of the Canada Energy Regulator (Commission)  issued Procedural Update No. 4 (C13017), which provided detailed information on the  oral proceeding for RH-001-2020.  On 19 May 2021, the oral proceeding began. At this time, the Commission is updating the tentative schedule, based on how the proceeding has progressed and updates to estimates provided by the parties (Appendix I). The Commission requests that any parties who have further changes to this update based on their current estimates raise such changes as a preliminary matter on the morning of 9 June 2021. The Commission appreciates parties’ assistance in providing estimates throughout the proceeding to allow the tentative schedule to be refined as the cross-examination continues.  As noted in Procedural Update No. 3 (C12714), the Commission has directed an oral summary argument process, which will include both written argument and oral submissions. Specifically, any participants wishing to participate in final argument must file written final argument. Oral argument will follow, but is optional, except for Enbridge, which is required to do both. Enbridge’s written final argument will be due 3 business days following the close of cross-examination, intervenors’ written argument will be due 2 business days after that.  The Commission also requires parties to file their intention to participate in oral argument, in writing, before the end of cross-examination.

Disposition and Background 1.1 Disposition  The Commission of the Canada Energy Regulator (Commission) has considered the Application of Campus regarding tolls and terms and conditions of service for its North Suffield Pipeline (the Pipeline). Having considered the evidence and submissions of all parties and for the reasons that follow, the Commission has decided the following2, with the Conditions set out in Order TG-003-2021 (Appendix II):  …/2                                                1 Now Campus. 2 This summarizes the decision and direction of the Commission with additional details provided below.  mailto:Jeremy.Baines@campusenergy.camailto:Robyn.Derech@campusenergy.camailto:lmanning@lawsonlundell.commailto:amackinnon@lawsonlundell.com Letter Decision Page 2 of 32 1. Campus may exercise its discretion and establish term-differentiated firm tolls that do not exceed $0.22/gigajoule (GJ);  2. Firm Transportation (FT) tolls to be filed by Campus are approved as final, effective as of the date of this decision and retroactive to the date they were made interim; 3. Campus is granted the discretion to set its Interruptible Transportation (IT) toll at market-responsive tolls of $0.32/GJ or lower;  4. Interruptible preferred service (ITp) is approved at a toll of the shipper’s corresponding FT service plus $0.02; 5. Interim IT tolls are made final for the period of 1 July 2019 to 30 April 2021;  6. Regarding the transportation service agreement (TSA or TSAs), the Commission approves modifying the existing notice period to three months but does not approve the proposed changes to the wording in Articles 5.4 and 5.5 of the TSA. The Commission instructs Campus to revert to the previous TSA provisions; and 7. The Commission does not approve the proposal for shippers to pay for all costs of testing at this time nor does the Commission approve the change from testing every three months to testing every 90 days, as requested by Campus. Background In June 2019, Rockpoint Gas Storage Canada Ltd. (Rockpoint), Pine Cliff Energy Ltd. (Pine Cliff), and Torxen Energy Ltd. (Torxen) (collectively, the Complainants) filed complaints with the National Energy Board (NEB) concerning the level of tolls charged by Suffield Processing Limited Partnership (SPLP) on the Pipeline. Following an exchange of comments, on 27 June 2019, the NEB issued Order TGI-003-2019 making the tolls specified in that order interim effective 1 July 2019. The NEB also directed Campus to provide the Complainants with continued service on the Pipeline under terms and conditions that are not unjustly discriminatory.  On 28 August 2019, the Canadian Energy Regulator Act (CER Act) came into force, replacing the National Energy Board Act (NEB Act). The NEB was succeeded by the Canada Energy Regulator (CER).  In a letter dated 21 February 2020, after a pause to allow for a potential negotiated resolution, the Commission found that the Complainants raised relevant concerns as to the appropriateness of the proposed tolls and terms and conditions of service. The Commission indicated that the record before it, including Campus’ limited filings in response to the Complaints, was insufficient to establish that the proposed tolls and terms and conditions of service were just and reasonable and ordered Campus to file an application for tolls and terms and conditions of service for the Pipeline. Campus filed its application on 8 April 2020 and additional information on 26 June 2020, after direction from the Commission to refile the application with additional information (see Appendix I – Ruling No. 1).  Letter Decision Page 3 of 32 Regulatory History of the South and North Suffield Pipelines Campus is the current owner of the South Suffield and North Suffield Pipelines (the Suffield System), which were approved by the NEB in 1998 (GH-2-98) and 2000 (GH-2-2000), respectively. The Pipeline is a 97.2 kilometre (km), 16-inch sales gas transmission line which transports gas from Alberta along the northern edge of the Suffield Canadian Forces Base, ending 2.6 km into Saskatchewan where it delivers into the TransCanada PipeLines Limited (TCPL) Mainline. It has a contractible capacity of 190 million cubic feet/day (approximately 200,460 GJ/day). There are seven receipt points (and six others on third-party feeder lines) and one delivery point along the Pipeline.  In the applications for both the North and South Suffield pipelines, the original owner described its system as a commercially at-risk pipeline and proposed market-based tolls, offering firm service terms of five to 20 years at fixed tolls. The firm service tolls incorporated a long-term incentive approach offering lower tolls for a longer-term commitment. The stated objective was to ensure the viability of the project while providing an acceptable return on investment, and to provide shippers with long-term certainty. The applicant submitted that the pipelines would provide shippers with an alternative to NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL).  https://docs2.cer-rec.gc.ca/ll-eng/llisapi.dll/fetch/2000/90464/90550/90697/90719/90722/1998-07-01_Reasons_for_Decision_GH-2-98.pdf?nodeid=90735&vernum=-2https://docs2.cer-rec.gc.ca/ll-eng/llisapi.dll/fetch/2000/90464/90550/90697/90720/90739/2000-08-01_Reasons_for_Decision_GH-2-2000.pdf?nodeid=90752&vernum=-2https://docs2.cer-rec.gc.ca/ll-eng/llisapi.dll/fetch/2000/90464/90550/554112/915551/1060220/2453041/2565524/B86-17__-14_GH-2-2000_Reasons_for_Decision_-_A4F3Z1.pdf?nodeid=2558000&vernum=-2 Letter Decision Page 4 of 32 One shipper subscribed for a large portion of the capacity on both the South and North Suffield pipelines for 20 year terms, which are nearing expiry.3 Other shippers also entered into contracts for smaller volumes. The NEB approved the South and North Suffield Pipeline applications finding that the pipelines will be required by the present and future public convenience and necessity. In  GH-2-98, on the topic of toll methodology, the NEB said4:  The differing points of view of shippers and pipeline owners are taken into account in considering whether a tolling methodology would result in just and reasonable tolls. Shippers will be concerned with the relative risk due to uncertainty about future toll levels. A pipeline company would be concerned about whether the tolling methodology would allow it to attract sufficient volumes to recover costs and provide an appropriate return on its investment;  Fixed tolls would not vary over their term in contrast to traditional cost of service tolls, where tolls are higher in the early years and lower for longer contract terms.5 Fixed tolls involve a different sharing of risks and rewards between the pipeline company and its shippers than would the sharing under cost of service regulation. Shippers would be relieved from the risk of asset under-utilization and would benefit from toll certainty. The pipeline company would be responsible for potential stranded assets and would assume any risk related to possible increases in costs due to inflation or rising financial costs6; and  As parties have a better understanding of their own circumstances, the solution agreed to may be superior to the solution the regulator could make through cost of service based tolls. The NEB determined that the Group 2 method of regulation would be acceptable for the pipelines and, in GH-2-2000 concluded that it was unnecessary to issue an order approving the proposed tolls and tariffs.7 1.2 Transfer of Ownership On 28 September 2018, a transfer application was filed with the NEB resulting in the eventual transfer of Suffield System ownership from AltaGas Holdings Inc. for and on behalf of AltaGas Pipeline Partnership (AltaGas) to Campus.8 The transfer application contained a statement that the purchaser “has no immediate plans to alter or implement any changes to the tolls and tariffs on the Pipelines”.9                                                 3  NEB Reasons for Decision – AEC Suffield Gas Pipeline Inc., GH-2-98, July 1998, 135.0 MMcdf, at 11; see also NEB, Reasons for Decision - AEC Suffield Gas Pipeline Inc., GH-2-2000, August 2000 - North Suffield Pipeline, 45 MMcfd, at 15. 4  NEB Reasons for Decision – AEC Suffield Gas Pipeline Inc., GH-2-98, July 1998, at 13-14. 5  Ibid at 14. 6  Ibid at 13. 7  NEB Reasons for Decision - AEC Suffield Gas Pipeline Inc., GH-2-2000, August 2000, at 12. It was clear in Chapter 4 of the Reasons for Decision that the pipeline at issue was described as being commercially at-risk and the NEB stated that the application “was not contested in this regard”.  8  On 1 October 2019, Suffield Processing Limited Partnership and its general partner 2133151 Alberta Ltd. formally changed names to become Campus Energy Partners Suffield LP and Campus Energy Partners Operations Inc., respectively (collectively referred to as Campus). 9  AltaGas Holdings Inc., for and on behalf of AltaGas Pipeline Partnership and 2133151 Alberta ltd. transfer application, at 8.  Letter Decision Page 5 of 32 At the time of the transfer application, AltaGas and Rockpoint were engaged in negotiations on terms of service on the Pipeline that became effective on 1 January 2019. The TSAs with each of the Complainants provided that tolls could only be changed once per year, with a 15 month notice period for all toll changes. The TSAs also contained a clause allowing either party to terminate the TSAs on 30 days’ notice. On 1 February 2019, the transfer was completed. Rockpoint said it entered into a tie-in agreement with AltaGas based on terms of its existing TSA and in reliance on representations made in the transfer application. This agreement allowed Rockpoint to construct a pipeline lateral associated with one of Rockpoint’s gas storage facilities into an AltaGas pipeline associated with the Pipeline. On 11 March 2019, Campus sent notification to Rockpoint and Torxen, both shippers on the Pipeline, giving notice of a toll change to firm and interruptible service and the TSA. On 22 March 2019, Rockpoint and Campus met to discuss the new offering. On the same date, Torxen, by way of letter to Campus, pointed out the significant increase in the firm and interruptible tolls. In June 2019, Campus advised Pine Cliff, Rockpoint and Torxen that the TSAs were terminated effective 30 June 2019. The issue raised by the Complainants regarding the representation made in the transfer application and subsequent conduct by the parties, as well as Campus’ response to these issues, is considered further below. 1.3 Procedural Matter – Objection by the Complainants In final argument, the Complainants objected to a portion10 of the Campus written final argument where Campus compared in detail its proposal for an accelerated depreciation rate to the proposal put forward by TCPL in RH-003-2011.11 The Complainants said that it is procedurally unfair to put forward a detailed comparison to facts in another hearing for the first time in argument. Similarly, the Complainants also objected to several paragraphs of the Campus written argument where Campus made comparisons between its IT toll design and the IT toll design in RH-003-2011, which it said were different operating contexts.12 The Complainants argued it is procedurally unfair that Campus make a comparison to facts in final argument when it did not file a complete factual record in its evidence about              RH-003-2011. The Complainants did not seek to strike any written argument filed by Campus, but argued these submissions should be given little or no weight. Regarding its references to RH-003-2011, Campus stated there is nothing inappropriate about filing evidence in one proceeding and then arguing that the filed evidence is analogous to facts or a related principle or outcome in a previous decision by the same tribunal. In any event, Campus said that RH-003-2011 was referred to in its Application as well as in a Commission Information Request (IR), so there was no basis for the Complainants to claim prejudice.                                                 10  The specific paragraph of the Campus written argument objected to was paragraph 100.  11  NEB Reasons for Decision, - TransCanada PipeLines Limited, NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd., and Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd., RH-003-2011, March 2013. 12  The specific paragraphs of the Campus written argument objected to were paragraphs 75, 76 and 126.  Letter Decision Page 6 of 32 Views of the Commission Overall, the Commission is not persuaded that the argument filed by Campus gives rise to any procedural unfairness. Once the facts about a current application are filed as evidence, as they were here, there is nothing generally unfair about comparing those facts or the position being put forward in a current application to the facts or principles from a past decision of the Commission, other tribunal decision or court case. Moreover, Campus referenced the context of RH-003-2011 in its application and the Commission also asked about potential comparisons to RH-003-2011 in an IR. Taking all this into consideration, there is no valid basis for claiming from a procedural fairness standpoint that the Complainants were unaware of the case being made or did not have opportunity to respond to it. That alone is not a basis for ascribing little or no weight to these precedents. Generally, the analogy to RH-003-2011 with respect to the Pipeline being underutilized and IT shippers receiving close to guaranteed access, was useful. The weight given to the comparison is discussed in Chapter 4. 2. Regulatory Framework The Application is subject to the CER Act.13 Section 230 requires: “All tolls must be just and reasonable, and must always, under substantially similar circumstances and conditions with respect to all traffic of the same description carried over the same route, be charged equally to all persons at the same rate.” Courts have previously emphasized the broad authority and discretion of the NEB to decide whether a proposed toll is just and reasonable. The same is true of tariff provisions. In considering Part IV of the NEB Act, the Federal Court of Appeal stated that the NEB was given “authority in the broadest possible terms to make orders with respect to all matters relating to [tolls and tariffs].”14 The Court went on to state that the power of the NEB was “not trammelled or fettered by statutory rules or discretion” with respect to the just and reasonableness of tolls.15 In the same case, the Court concluded that when the NEB was considering tolls there was no requirement for the NEB to adopt “any particular accounting approach or device”.16 The Court said this includes no requirement to determine tolls using “cost of service and a rate based and fixing a fair return thereon”. In other words, the NEB or the Commission as it is now, may consider cost of service information but there is no requirement to consider the just and reasonableness of tolls using this methodology. The above direction of the Federal Court of Appeal was followed by the NEB in Alliance Pipeline Ltd. where the NEB stated:17                                                 13 The Application was filed after the CER Act was in force. As a result it was considered under the CER Act. In any event, the CER Act toll and tariff provisions at issue for this hearing did not change substantively compared to the NEB Act.  14 British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority v Westcoast Transmission Limited, [1981] 2 F.C. 646 (Fed.

Letter Decision Page 7 of 32 [T]here may be several approaches to tolling that yield just and reasonable results. Each approach should be considered on its own merits and in respect of the many diverse factors that compromise its circumstances.  Other than a small change to modernize language, section 230 of the CER Act is the same as the previous section 62 of the NEB Act considered by the Courts. There continue to be no statutory rules which restrict the Commission’s authority to set just and reasonable tolls. For these reasons, the Commission is of the view that previous direction from the Courts regarding the toll and tariff provisions of the NEB Act continue to have direct application to the CER Act and to the Commission. Past NEB cases such as Alliance are also informative. The overarching requirement is that tolls must always be just and reasonable. The Commission has wide discretion regarding the factors to consider in assessing the justness and reasonableness of tolls. In the Milk River decision the NEB discussed the role of economic regulation, and stated that,18 [E]conomic regulation is designed to prevent the potential abuse of market power by a company operating in a monopolistic environment or in one with limited competition. Regulation ensures that such a company charges rates which are fair to customers and provides the company with a reasonable opportunity to earn a fair return on its capital investment. The [NEB] agrees with Murphy that effective competition exists when customers of a service have the ability to obtain comparable services at reasonable prices from alternative suppliers and market participants are not in a position to exercise market power. The role of the Commission to prevent the potential abuse of market power remains important.  In previous decisions19, a number of tolling principles have been adopted by the NEB and the Commission when assessing whether a toll is just and reasonable. These tolling principles include cost-based/user-pay, economic efficiency, and no acquired rights. The regulation of tolls and tariffs of Group 2 companies is normally carried out on a complaint basis, which does not eliminate the need for appropriate sharing of information by these companies. A Group 2 company must file tolls and tariffs with the CER before charging tolls to any shippers20, and it is the responsibility of a Group 2 company to provide its shippers and interested parties with sufficient information to enable them to determine whether a complaint is warranted21. In the event of a complaint, the CER may request additional information including some or all of the information required of Group 1 companies as specified in sections P.1 through P.5 in Guide P of the CER’s Filing Manual.                                                 18 NEB Letter Decision - Murphy Oil Company Ltd., Concerning Tolls for the Milk River Pipeline (Milk River), August 2001, at 4. 19 NEB Reasons for Decision - TransCanada PipeLines Limited, RH-1-2007, July 2007, Chapter 3, at 21-23, A16008-1. 20 Subsection 229(1) of the CER Act. 21 CER Filing Manual, Guide P, P.6 Regulation of the Traffic, Tolls and Tariffs of Group 2 Companies. https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/470970 Letter Decision Page 8 of 32 There are several other requirements [Link22] for Group 2 companies regarding accounting and financial reporting, abandonment funding, change in ownership and financial regulatory audits. Notably, a Group 2 company is also required to:  Maintain separate books of account and to file annual audited financial statements with the CER within 120 days of the end of the fiscal year;  File an abandonment cost estimate and set-aside mechanism with the CER for Commission approval, and apply to the CER for any changes to an abandonment cost estimate;  File an annual abandonment funding reporting form;  Maintain financial resources to cover the costs of an unintended or uncontrolled release from a pipeline; and   Make the company’s books, accounts, and records readily accessible by CER staff during a financial regulatory audit. The Commission may set interim tolls and may make subsequent orders regarding refunds or recoveries as outlined in section 232 of the CER Act which states: If the Commission has made an interim order authorizing a company to charge tolls until a specified time or the happening of a specified event, the Commission may, in any subsequent order, direct the company (a) to refund, in the manner that the Commission considers appropriate, the part of the tolls charged under the interim order that is in excess of the tolls determined by the Commission to be just and reasonable, together with interest on the amount to be refunded; or (b) to recover in its tolls, in the manner that the Commission considers appropriate, the amount by which the tolls determined by the Commission to be just and reasonable exceed the tolls charged under the interim order, together with interest on the amount to be recovered. 3. Tolls for firm service The Commission considered all the parties’ submissions, including their evidence and views regarding market-based tolls and cost of service tolls and the overall question of just and reasonable tolls for the Pipeline. Views of Campus Campus’ key submissions regarding market-based tolls focused on the history and earlier regulatory approvals of the Suffield System and the ongoing appropriateness of a market-based methodology. Campus emphasized that the Suffield System was approved by the NEB as commercially at-risk. Campus highlighted that the Pipeline took on greater risks                                                 22 “Financial Regulation of Group 2 Pipeline Companies” (10 July 2020), online: CER <https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/about/acts-regulations/cer-act-regulations-guidance-notes-related-documents/tolls-tariffs-accounting/financial-regulation-group-2-pipeline-companies.html>. https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/about/acts-regulations/cer-act-regulations-guidance-notes-related-documents/tolls-tariffs-accounting/financial-regulation-group-2-pipeline-companies.pdfhttps://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cer-rec.gc.ca%2Fen%2Fabout%2Facts-regulations%2Fcer-act-regulations-guidance-notes-related-documents%2Ftolls-tariffs-accounting%2Ffinancial-regulation-group-2-pipeline-companies.html&data=04%7C01%7CChristine.Davidson%40cer-rec.gc.ca%7C46e47e5023f14e820c9708d8e89ee63b%7C56e9b8d38a3549abbdfc27de59608f01%7C0%7C0%7C637515116448345655%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=0pEVjL6dXVNTg5KBZqgAbROao230SgQ5dZn9TqShngk%3D&reserved=0https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cer-rec.gc.ca%2Fen%2Fabout%2Facts-regulations%2Fcer-act-regulations-guidance-notes-related-documents%2Ftolls-tariffs-accounting%2Ffinancial-regulation-group-2-pipeline-companies.html&data=04%7C01%7CChristine.Davidson%40cer-rec.gc.ca%7C46e47e5023f14e820c9708d8e89ee63b%7C56e9b8d38a3549abbdfc27de59608f01%7C0%7C0%7C637515116448345655%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=0pEVjL6dXVNTg5KBZqgAbROao230SgQ5dZn9TqShngk%3D&reserved=0https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cer-rec.gc.ca%2Fen%2Fabout%2Facts-regulations%2Fcer-act-regulations-guidance-notes-related-documents%2Ftolls-tariffs-accounting%2Ffinancial-regulation-group-2-pipeline-companies.html&data=04%7C01%7CChristine.Davidson%40cer-rec.gc.ca%7C46e47e5023f14e820c9708d8e89ee63b%7C56e9b8d38a3549abbdfc27de59608f01%7C0%7C0%7C637515116448345655%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=0pEVjL6dXVNTg5KBZqgAbROao230SgQ5dZn9TqShngk%3D&reserved=0 Letter Decision Page 9 of 32 under the original long term contracts in place in 2000 than it would otherwise have had to under cost of service regulation and that market-based tolls provided needed flexibility to attract FT revenue.  Campus proposed to continue its operations as a Group 2 pipeline charging market-based tolls. Campus submitted that current market and Pipeline circumstances would result in cost of service tolls that Campus could not charge in the market. Relevant circumstances noted by Campus included: depressed gas markets, declining volumes, very small shipper base, the potential end of the long-term contracts and associated volumes, declining credit quality of potential shippers, and an aging pipeline that will require further integrity management and incremental operating, maintenance and capital expenditures as it gets closer to the end of its service. Campus indicated that there was shipper support for the proposed tolls as it held discussions with several interested shippers, and a contract was executed with GEX Resources subscribing for a five-year term of firm-service. Campus proposed to competitively price the Pipeline’s service options, as was done under the long-term contracts when the pipelines were initially approved. Shippers, and prospective shippers, could alternatively choose to seek transportation service from NGTL, which is a cost of service based transportation service provider. Campus submitted that the NGTL system remains a readily available alternative for Suffield System shippers. Campus noted that though they have the capability, none of the Complainants are currently shipping on the Pipeline. Campus indicated that the Complainants confirmed that they have the ability to divert volume between the Pipeline and NGTL based on price, with the exception of a small proportion of Torxen production, which potentially could be connected to NGTL. In response to concerns raised about the process it followed with respect to the applied-for tolls, Campus conceded the process was not perfect but noted that there had been shipper consultation over multiple months. Campus also introduced a new two-year firm and new IT service to address the producer desire for shorter and more flexible options. In any event, Campus submitted that the concerns raised about its process do not resolve the substantive question about whether its applied for toll is just and reasonable. Campus said that while previous AltaGas TSAs were terminated, this was all based on the freely agreed to 30-day termination clause that was a lawful exercise of a free-granted contractual right.  Factors cited by Campus as relevant in deciding whether to depart from market-based tolling principles are as follows:   Whether the competitive relationship between the Pipeline and NGTL is materially different than when it came into service;   Whether current and prospective shippers can find alternatives;   The extent to which current and prospective shippers have used alternatives in the past; and   Whether the Pipeline has been shown to have market power. If so, whether it has been shown to have abused market power and whether any of the shippers have ever had their volumes interrupted or curtailed for the Pipeline.   Letter Decision Page 10 of 32 Campus submitted these are all relevant factors in favour of maintaining market-based tolling for the Pipeline. Campus went on to argue that its tolls compare favourably with NGTL tolls. It said it has been established in this hearing that it is in a low load factor environment and shippers under the previous interruptible service tolls were not incentivized to subscribe to firm service. Campus said it was not necessary to consider cost of service information with respect to its tolls since each tolling method must be considered on its own merit. Campus submitted that cost of service regulation at this stage in the life of the Suffield System would be inappropriate. It would undo the sharing of commercial risk that the NEB found appropriate in GH-2-98 and GH-2-2000 and potentially result in a transfer of the risk of asset underutilization and stranded costs to shippers in the current market. In response to the issue of cost of service methodology, Campus went on to note that the Pipeline has never operated as a cost of service pipeline. As such, there was never an approved rate base, capital structure, or return on rate base for the pipeline; and cost of service information was never tracked for the Pipeline because it was never necessary. Campus did not track the book value or net book value of the Pipeline separately from the total value of the Property, Plant and Equipment recorded in Campus’ financial statements. Campus therefore had to estimate certain information used in the Illustrative Cost of service Toll Model.  Campus submitted that changing the toll structure on the Pipeline to a cost of service regime would shorten the economic life of the pipeline. Campus said that cost of service tolls would be uncompetitive in the market and it would therefore not be able to attract new volumes to the system. If the pipeline transitioned to a cost of service basis it would have to charge very high tolls on declining throughput, which would shorten the pipeline’s estimated remaining economic life to match the ten years of reserves left of its remaining firm shipper. Campus calculated a unit cost of service estimate of $0.392/GJ (which includes an abandonment surcharge of $0.082/GJ) for 2020 based on the estimates and assumptions that it provided. Campus put forward several parameters and assumptions in its Application that the Complainants agreed with, or did not directly dispute. These include the following:   As the Suffield System is operated on an integrated basis, it is necessary to allocate the costs of the integrated system between the North and South Suffield pipelines;  It is appropriate to use different allocation ratios for capital components of costs and operating components of costs;  The methodology and relevant inputs to determine the capital cost allocation ratio;   The operating and maintenance costs, with the exception of the costs associated with the surety bond premium;  Campus’ estimate of Gross Plant in Service;   The gross amount of taxes other than income taxes;  The methodology used to estimate current income taxes, as well as the Capital Cost Allowance amounts and Undepreciated Capital Cost pools;  Regulatory costs;  Working capital;  Letter Decision Page 11 of 32  General agreement with the industry risk factors as they are laid out in the Application; and  Interest rates. Regarding contested factors, Campus submitted the following:  Up until 2019, it assumed that the estimated capital cost of the Pipeline was depreciated at a rate of 2.5 per cent per year, based on the original forecast of a 40 year asset life. In its cost of service toll calculation, Campus applied a depreciation rate of ten per cent per year starting in 2019.   The Suffield System is operated on an integrated basis and records costs on an aggregate basis. For purposes of this Application, Campus allocated operating and maintenance, general and administrative, and property tax expenses based on the Pipeline’s volumetric capacity (52.055 per cent) relative to the system as a whole, and capital cost allowances, gross plant in service, and abandonment costs based upon the estimated capital investment in the Pipeline (49.446 per cent) relative to the system as a whole.   Campus used its actual capital structure (36 per cent debt and 64 per cent equity), its actual cost of debt (4.00 per cent in 2019 and 3.80 per cent for 2020), and a return on equity (ROE) of 15.0 per cent to estimate its cost of capital. Campus asserted that its actual capital structure was selected because it is the closest comparable transaction for the amount of leverage that either a prudent owner would place on the assets, or that a bank would be willing to lend on the assets. Campus provided a comparison to other gas transportation and distribution utilities, indicating that the risk profiles of the comparable pipelines were substantially lower than Campus’ and would support higher leverage ratios. Campus submitted the Complainants’ deemed 60-40 debt-to-equity ratio should be given no weight, given the lack of similarity in risk profiles to the Complainants’ comparators in relation to risk, credit ratings, size and other factors.   Campus estimated the actual ROE realized on the Suffield System for the last five years as quite volatile, ranging from -14.1 per cent to 17.3 per cent. For 2019, Campus’ actual return was 7.5 per cent. Based on its risk profile, the comparative company analysis, and the capital asset pricing model analysis, Campus stated that a 15 per cent ROE would be required to attract capital to its business.  Campus submitted that the current underutilization of the Pipeline presents several challenges. Interruptible service is effectively just as reliable as firm service, because of the Pipeline’s excess unused capacity. Thus, there is little incentive for shippers to subscribe for firm service, and make any long-term financial commitment to the Pipeline, especially when interruptible tolls are only marginally higher than firm tolls. Campus stated that changing from market-based tolls to cost of service tolls is also not economically viable. Under cost of service tolling, low throughput results in a high unit cost of service that would not be competitive with NGTL’s tolls. Campus’ Illustrative Cost of Service Toll Model illustrates this difficulty. Campus believes cost of service tolls could lead to a death spiral for the Pipeline.  Campus stated that its proposed tolls align with and continue to achieve the original mission and vision of the Pipeline which is to provide a lower-cost alternative to the NGTL system for transporting gas from the Suffield area to the TransCanada Mainline. Campus’ proposed tolls  Letter Decision Page 12 of 32 were established in consultation with its shippers, and are intended to strike a careful balance between producer economics, market requirements, competition alternatives, and the pipeline economics of the North Suffield pipeline. Campus maintains that the balance struck is just and reasonable to both Campus and its shippers. Campus requested that if the proposed tolls cannot be approved, the Commission should set market-based tolls consistent with the tolling principles used to originally approve the Suffield System. Views of the Complainants In the absence of negotiated market-based tolls, the Complainants argued in favour of a cost of service tolling method being imposed on Campus. The Complainants argued in the alternative that the most appropriate market-based tolls the Commission could impose would be those in the Complainants' TSAs with AltaGas, which had commercial support and were not challenged by any shippers or prospective shippers on the Pipeline. The Complainants say the proposed tolls are too high and not competitive with the tolls and services offered on the NGTL system. As a result, the Complainants left the Pipeline. A portion of Torxen’s volumes are captive to the Pipeline and cannot move to NGTL. Torxen stated that the circumstances of each individual case must be considered for market support and while shipper support is vital to tolls being just and reasonable, it is not fatal. The Complainants asserted that the original proponent of the Pipeline was to be regulated on a complaint basis as a Group 2 company. Prior acceptance by the NEB of a ""market-based"" toll methodology for a pipeline at a point in time does not insulate new tolls, or the tolling methodology, on the Pipeline from the Commission’s review or the statutory requirement that such tolls be just and reasonable. If the Commission were not able to review new tolls, or the tolling methodology on a pipeline, this would undermine the complaint-based regulation of Group 2 companies and enable pipeline companies to routinely earn amounts well in excess of a fair rate of return, without oversight from the Commission. The Complainants said that having cost of service information was essential to complaint based regulation. The Complainants said both the NEB and Commission have long required costs of service information listed in Guide P of the Filing Manual to be provided when there is a complaint against a Group 2 Company. In the view of the Complainants, without this requirement, a regulator could not satisfy itself that the primary toll principal of cost causation was satisfied. Past precedents such as Milk River support the view that, in a complaint proceeding, costs of service justification is required and should guide the review. The Complainants stated that Campus cancelled their TSAs in order to dramatically increase tolls and impose more onerous shipper terms and conditions. This was done despite the fact that the former TSAs have a 15 month notice clause for any toll changes and the representation in the transfer application that there were no immediate plans to alter the tolls or conditions of service. The Complainants submitted that Campus exerted its market power to force them off the Pipeline unless and until they agreed to higher tolls and more onerous terms than had existed in the contracts executed with the prior owner, AltaGas. If the proposed tolls are accepted it is likely that Rockpoint and Pine Cliff would continue not to utilize the Pipeline, and Torxen would look to remove or reduce its volumes transported on the Pipeline. The Complainants argued that Campus took the view that as long as NGTL was potentially a competitive option, it could impose the tolls and terms that it wanted. The Complainants further asserted that Campus’ “take it or leave it” attitude does not result in just and reasonable tolls. The Complainants said that the above conduct of Campus amounted to duress and/or oppression.  Letter Decision Page 13 of 32 Based on their estimates and assumptions, the Complainants calculated a unit cost of service estimate of $0.12/GJ (which includes an abandonment surcharge of $0.005/GJ). The Complainants challenged a number of inputs used by Campus to calculate its unit cost of service, including the following:  The reduction in Campus’ estimated economic life of the Pipeline from 40 years to 26 years from construction. This reduction is not reasonable or consistent with other Campus representations regarding depreciation. For example, Campus’ own GAAP23-based financial reporting, reviewed by senior management and Campus' auditors, extended the economic life further to 2049. The Complainants stated that consistency was needed between the selected historical depreciation life used to calculate the opening net book value on acquisition and the assumed remaining economic life and that the same depreciation methodology needed to be applied consistently throughout. The Complainants submitted that the form of regulation should not dictate the used and useful life of an asset, and Campus should not be permitted to change a key economic term in the face of a complaint from its shippers.  The Complainants disagreed with Campus’ proposal to allocate operating costs based on the ratio of the capacity of the North and South Suffield pipelines. The Complainants indicated that as the Pipeline has a greater available capacity than the South Suffield pipeline, but the South line has a greater proportion of volume shipped, Campus’ methodology results in the subsidization of costs of the South Suffield pipeline by the Pipeline. The Complainants submitted that allocating these costs based on relative actual use results in a fairer allocation of costs than based on capacity between the North and South Suffield pipelines. In response to the Commission’s IR, the Complainants acknowledged that the operating costs, and general and administrative costs, are relatively fixed and would likely not vary substantially with volumes of gas transported.  The Complainants proposed a deemed capital structure of 40 per cent equity and 60 per cent debt and an ROE of ten per cent for cost of service tolls, based on an examination of the regulatory capital structures of other regulated assets. The Complainants suggested these as good comparators to the Pipeline because of a similar regulatory framework, substantially similar types of users, and a similar geographic location resulting in similar economic supply and demand factors as the Pipeline. The Complainants noted inherent volatility and exposure to commodity risk associated with pure gas transmission differs from oil and natural gas liquids midstream investments. The Complainants stated that the current level of underutilization was the result of the choices made by the new management and do not reflect the basic risks of the Pipeline.  The Complainants explained that their analysis of cost of capital comparators was similar to Campus' approach which evaluated the entities at a high level.   The Complainants also raised a concern that using Campus’ actual capital structure and its business ROE is an internally inconsistent assumption if the denominator used in determining the per unit tolls is based on average annual volumes on the Pipeline. The Complainants noted that the Pipeline has averaged approximately 35 per cent annual utilization from 1 January 2018 to 31 July 2020. The Complainants’ concern is that as Campus’ total cost of service is relatively fixed,                                                 23 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  Letter Decision Page 14 of 32 incremental volumes would add exponentially to the return earned by Campus if Campus' proposed capital structure and ROE were used.  Views of the Commission Just and Reasonable Tolls The parties in this case tendered lengthy submissions regarding market-based and cost of service methodologies. The Commission will always consider the specific circumstances of and the evidence provided by the parties when exercising its broad discretion to assess whether tolls are just and reasonable. In this case, the Commission is of the view that both methodologies, if applied strictly, would be potentially problematic for the Pipeline and its shippers. The Commission is persuaded that Campus requires a degree of flexibility to achieve efficient outcomes for the Pipeline, but also finds that a firm service toll range that is more cost reflective than the range applied for by Campus is just and reasonable. Accordingly, the Commission has determined that Campus may exercise its discretion and establish term-differentiated firm tolls, provided that such firm service tolls do not exceed $0.22/GJ, as further detailed below.  The Commission considered the precedent cases argued by the parties. Many of the precedent toll decisions cited in this proceeding are distinguishable from the current case. In Alliance, a precedent that Campus referenced, while the NEB said it did not rely on the cost information filed, that was a situation where a large majority of shippers signed agreements with the pipeline company and took no issue with the tolling methodology.24 That is a different circumstance than the current situation in this Application. Additionally, as the Complainants correctly point out, in Express, the NEB placed reliance on the business judgment of shippers making contractual commitments. In Express, 85% of the pipeline capacity had been contracted.25 Again, that can be distinguished from the current Application. With respect to the NEB’s approval of the Pipeline and reasons in GH-2-2000, the Commission is of the view that the original toll methodology is not determinative as to whether current tolls are just and reasonable. The Complainants are not barred from arguing that cost of service information is relevant to the current Application and challenging whether the applied-for tolls are just and reasonable. There is no bar to Campus arguing that tolls should be approved using a methodology similar to the submissions of the applicant in     GH-2-2000 and the Commission notes that regulatory predictability is a relevant consideration. In this decision, the Commission does not intend to re-allocate the balance of risks and rewards on the Pipeline. Campus has operated and continues to operate bearing utilization risk and the ability to structure tolls to be market responsive and incent utilization. The Commission notes that Campus aspires to grow throughput and attract volumes to the Pipeline. The Commission is of the view that Campus should retain the flexibility to work together with its shippers to find market solutions in the future. Nonetheless, the Commission is of the view that Campus did not establish the appropriateness of a purely market-based toll. By its nature, a market-based toll involves limited inquiry into the cost drivers of the pipeline and the returns earned by the pipeline. To establish such a toll is just and reasonable, the NEB has previously expected a company to demonstrate a high degree of market acceptance of the toll, an absence of market power                                                 24 Alliance, supra note 17 at 34 and 42. 25 NEB Reasons for Decision, Express Pipeline Ltd., OH-1-95, June 1996, at 23.  Letter Decision Page 15 of 32 that could result in abuse, and fair and transparent engagement between the pipeline and its shippers and interested parties. The Commission expects that, in general, an appropriate sharing of risks and benefits has likely been allocated between the pipeline and its shippers if these indicators are well established. While these indicators are relevant in the current case the overall test remains that tolls must be just and reasonable. With respect to Campus’ applied-for market-based tolls, the Commission has concerns regarding the following:  Instead of a high degree of market acceptance, the Commission finds that there is little evidence of market support such as new or renewed contracts under Campus’ proposed tolling structure and broad opposition to the tolls, as applied for. While unanimous support is not necessarily an essential requirement, in the Application, the opposition and limited evidence of other shipper support or contracting indicates that the allocation of risk and benefits may not be reasonable.  The Commission finds, owing to the presence of NGTL, Campus generally would experience some competitive checks on its opportunity to exert market power. However, one shipper, Torxen, has a portion of its production effectively captive to Campus’ services. Further, the existence of one competitor does not necessarily mean that a fully competitive market is operating. Though shippers on the Pipeline can use NGTL as an alternative, and in most cases the Complainants have done so26, this does not necessarily mean that the tolls on the Pipeline should be charged at any rate up to what might be considered a quality-adjusted rate charged by NGTL for the same full-path service, especially given that the systems operate in significantly different ways, with different service attributes, and access to different markets. Therefore, a higher degree of scrutiny on market power is appropriate.  With respect to Campus’ dealings with its shippers upon assuming ownership of the Pipeline, specifically termination of contracts, that alone does not constitute an abuse of market power.  Appropriate engagement with shippers and interested parties is particularly important when a pipeline seeks to use market-based tolls to ensure parties can freely and fairly participate in toll discussions with an understanding of the true risks and benefits that the pipeline seeks to allocate. The Commission acknowledges that Campus did engage shippers by providing term sheets, meeting with shippers, and offering to participate in alternate dispute resolution. However, the Commission finds Campus’ early cancellation of contracts in the face of a 15-month notice period for toll changes, coupled with deficient sharing of relevant information in that same time period indicates a lack of transparency27. This was not remedied until the regulatory process was commenced and Campus eventually responded to the Commission’s specific disclosure requirements. With respect to the statement in the transfer                                                 26 Rockpoint, Pine Cliff and Torxen - Written Evidence of the Complainants, PDF at 12 of 39, C09222-2; Complainants' Responses to Commission IR No. 2, PDF at 12, 14, and 16 of 24, C10050-2; Campus, Reply Evidence at 8 of 17, C10255-2.  27 The Commission’s finding should not be interpreted as making a finding about whether contracts were breached or not breached. Appropriately, the Commission was asked to consider whether there was unfair termination of the TSAs and not whether contracts were breached. The Commission may interpret contracts to the extent they are relevant to the Commission’s statutory authority concerning the just and reasonableness of tolls. In this case there was both a 30 day termination clause in the TSAs and a clause providing a 15 month notice period for toll changes.  https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4010315https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/File/Download/4025778https://docs2.cer-rec.gc.ca/ll-eng/llisapi.dll/fetch/2000/90465/92837/3827917/3908276/4017810/4027978/C10255-2_Campus_Reply_Evidence_-_A7L5K5.pdf?nodeid=4028265&vernum=-2 Letter Decision Page 16 of 32 application that the applicants had no immediate plans to implement changes to the tolls and tariffs, once Campus was aware that the previous representation to the NEB was no longer fully accurate, it had an obligation to notify the CER and shippers. With respect to the Complainants’ claims of duress and oppression, limited evidence and argument was tendered by the Complainants. In the Commission’s view, the Complainants have not made out a case for how duress or oppression specifically applies. As noted above, the Commission is persuaded that Campus did not engage fairly and transparently with its shippers throughout their dispute regarding tolls. However, given the lack of evidence and detail about what the test for duress or oppression is or how it should be applied (including whether this is within the Commission’s authority), the Commission dismisses these claims. Recognizing the deficiencies associated with the applied-for market-based tolls, the Commission considered whether cost of service tolls could be appropriate. The Commission considers that some of the cost information provided was useful and relevant, but finds that neither party succeeded in providing cost of service evidence that was conclusive. The Commission notes that the Complainants acknowledged, in their discussion of alternative relief, that a market-based toll in an appropriate range could be just and reasonable. Overall, the Commission finds that a cost of service methodology would not be appropriate for the Pipeline for the reasons articulated below.  First, the Commission accepts that the past and current circumstances of the Pipeline - namely, operating commercially at risk historically and currently facing challenges of sustained declining throughput28– support that Campus should have flexibility in toll setting to effectively attract volumes to the Pipeline. In particular, the Commission is persuaded that such flexibility is appropriate to help with the viability of the Pipeline in a period of declining throughput and significant contract transitions. Second, shippers on the Pipeline have indicated a desire for certainty with respect to tolls on the Pipeline. With the expiry of long term contracts pending and associated throughput uncertainty, a cost of service tolling regime would not provide toll predictability and could result in toll instability.  Finally, if the Pipeline were required to operate on a cost of service basis it would have to forecast annual revenues and expenses in consultation with shippers, perform annual toll recalculations, modify existing contracts, and file additional information on a regular basis. It may also have to use a deemed capital structure, earn a regulated ROE, and maintain full regulatory accounting records. The Commission considers this administrative burden is likely excessive in Campus’ circumstances. After weighing the evidence of this proceeding and considering the current circumstances of the Pipeline, the Commission has decided to approve a cost-informed toll range within the existing toll framework for the Pipeline. This framework includes being regulated as a Group 2 company, offering term-differentiated firm tolls, and managing its risks outside of a cost of service methodology. In setting a cost-informed toll range, the Commission has used the cost information provided by both parties with a view to determining a toll range between the market-based tolls applied for by Campus and the previous AltaGas tolls urged by the Complainants. Under a tolling method that is not purely cost of service, the consideration of costs must be weighed against the balance of risks shared between the Pipeline and its                                                 28 Campus, Reply Evidence, at 12 of 17, C10255-2.  Letter Decision Page 17 of 32 shippers. In considering the current complaint, costs can assist in determining the reasonableness of the tolls when framed by the risk balance between parties. The Commission assessed the following factors:  Regarding rate base and depreciation, the Commission accepts the 2018 rate base, as agreed upon by Campus and the Complainants. However, the Commission finds that Campus has not established a rational basis for significant changes to its depreciation rate. In particular, the Commission notes that Campus has made different statements about the economic life of the Pipeline for different purposes. Given the contradictions and lack of detailed evidence to support changes to the underlying assumptions, such as a depreciation study, 29 the Commission gives little weight to Campus’ new ten-year estimate of remaining economic life of the Pipeline. For the purposes of this proceeding, the Commission agrees with the Complainants that the depreciation rate of 2.5 per cent per year should continue to be used.  The Commission gives more weight to Campus’ proposed allocation method based on the capacity of each pipeline. An allocation based on annual throughput, such as the Complainants’ proposed allocation method, would result in costs being transferred back and forth between the North and South Suffield pipelines from year to year. This would not lead to stable and predictable tolls. Allocating the costs based on variable throughput would also be less aligned with the cost causation principle as the majority of the costs are relatively fixed.  With respect to cost of capital, the Commission does not accept that Campus should use the actual cost of capital for the suite of assets it acquired, some of which may be more risky than the Pipeline. Conversely, there is limited application for the comparable entities provided by the Complainants. The Commission believes a reasonable cost of capital would be higher than that proposed by the Complainants as the Pipeline faces higher risk due to throughput risk, low utilization, and the presence of NGTL as a competing pipeline. As the Pipeline is a relatively small pipeline with a smaller, variable shipper base, the ROE is likely closer to that which would result from Campus’ proposed ROE. A more moderate capital structure than proposed by Campus would be appropriate. Therefore, the most reasonable cost of capital lies in between the proposals submitted by Campus and the Complainants.  Finally, with respect to throughput, the evidence indicates throughput is declining and is increasingly supplied by uncommitted volumes30. No significant evidence was tendered to establish that the declines are likely to reverse. The Commission is of the view the most reasonable assumption is that throughput will continue to decline somewhat. Campus will be required to file throughput data so that interested parties will be informed of actual throughput levels. Complete cost of service information was not provided to the Commission and a true cost of service toll for service on the Pipeline cannot be exactly determined. However, using the agreed upon rate base, Campus’ cost allocation methodology, the Complainants’ depreciation rate and a moderate cost of capital, the Commission estimates that a cost-based toll would likely fall within the range of the previous five-year firm toll of $0.165/GJ and                                                 29 The Commission gave some weight to the argument of the Complainants that there is previous NEB precedent that changes to pipeline methodology should be underpinned by comprehensive analysis. See NEB, Reasons for Decision – TransCanada PipeLines Limited, RH-1-2002, July 2003.  30 Campus, Response to Commission IR No. 1 at 10 of 12, C08291-2. https://docs2.cer-rec.gc.ca/ll-eng/llisapi.dll/fetch/2000/90465/92837/3827917/3908276/4017810/3965997/C08291-2_Campus_Response_to_CER_IR_No._1_-_A7I4I9.pdf?nodeid=3966104&vernum=-2 Letter Decision Page 18 of 32 the proposed five-year firm toll of $0.22/GJ. The Commission finds that tolls within this range should adequately protect shippers against Campus’ potential ability to exert market power, while still providing Campus sufficient opportunity to be reasonably compensated. The Commission finds that a toll in the above range is just and reasonable and, on that basis, directs Campus to re-issue term differentiated tolls not exceeding $0.22/GJ. The evidence provided does not establish that the Pipeline is likely to earn an excessive return based on the information currently available, particularly given that realized rates of return on the Pipeline will fluctuate – a risk accepted by Campus. The Commission never waives its authority to examine whether the returns earned over time by a pipeline are excessive, even if a market-based toll is approved. If circumstances change in the future, a new toll proposal or a complaint may be brought forward. However, the Commission encourages Campus and its shippers to work together to find market solutions in the future. Term Differentiated Fixed Tolls  The Commission accepts that term differentiated fixed tolls have the benefit of toll stability over a fixed term and incent longer contracting on the Pipeline. Shippers on the Pipeline have indicated a desire for certainty with respect to tolls on the pipeline. By 1 May 2021, Campus is required to file with the CER a toll filing that includes term differentiated firm service tolls not exceeding $0.22/GJ. Campus must include a two-year firm toll as a recourse toll. Depending on the balancing of risks and benefits, the two-year firm toll may or may not include all benefits awarded to longer term commitments such as the right to use ITp service, discussed further below. Campus bears the risk of underutilization and ultimately fundamental risk. Campus should set tolls that send the proper price signals to the market and increase utilization.  Interim Tolls for Firm Service  The Commission did not receive submissions regarding the interim tolls for firm service. The FT tolls to be filed by Campus are approved as final, effective as of the date of this decision and retroactive to the date they were made interim.  Regulatory Filing and Disclosure Requirements There was considerable dispute amongst the parties regarding the level of cost of service detail to be provided in response to a complaint. With respect to the financial regulation of Group 2 companies, the Filing Manual specifies that every Group 2 company has a responsibility “to provide its shippers and interested parties with sufficient information to enable them to determine whether a complaint is warranted.” A Group 2 Company is also required to make copies of tariffs and supporting financial information readily available. When a complaint is filed, Guide P of the Filing Manual indicates that the Commission may require some or all information required of Group 1 companies as specified in sections P.1 to P.5. With respect to this Application, in its letter of 21 February 2020, the Commission directed Campus to provide the information set out in parts P.1 to P.5. It was not until the revised Application was filed on 26 June 2020 that both the Complainants and the Commission had sufficient financial information to assess whether the tolls proposed by Campus were just and reasonable. In this case, Campus should have offered a more timely response to the Complainants’ requests for financial information. Nothing in the Filing Manual, the Group 2 framework, or prior decisions of the NEB or Commission relieves a Group 2 pipeline of the obligation to furnish justification, which includes supporting financial information, for proposed tolls which are the subject of a https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/applications-hearings/submit-applications-documents/filing-manuals/filing-manual/filing-manual.pdf Letter Decision Page 19 of 32 complaint. The Commission expects its regulated companies to provide adequate information upon request from the CER and, at all times, to engage fairly and transparently with its shippers and interested parties. Specifically, the Commission reiterates that it is imperative that as a Group 2 pipeline, Campus must share underlying financial information, including the information that would be used in cost of service calculations, with its shippers when requested regardless of the toll methodology used on the Pipeline. The Commission is not making compliance findings at this time. However the Commission reminds Campus that the Gas Pipeline Uniform Accounting Regulations require a Group 2 company’s accounting records to provide sufficient information to fully explain the facts pertaining to all entries made in the accounts and maintain records that may be useful in determining the history of or facts pertaining to any transaction. Additional Commission Direction  To encourage transparency in Campus’ relationship with current and potential shippers, the Commission directs Campus to provide three months of notice for changes to firm service tolls and IT tolls31. This does not apply to the discretion regarding IT tolls discussed in section 4.1. This will give shippers time to review proposed changes, seek additional information, and file a complaint with the CER if warranted. Campus is required to include this notice provision in its CER tariff. The revised tariff must be filed with the CER by 1 May 2021.  Campus is required to file traffic data with the CER as discussed in section 4.1 and outlined in Condition 3 in TG-003-2021 (Appendix II). Traffic data and financial information can be used in the future to approximate the pipeline’s notional cost-based tolls and ROE. The Commission believes this data will assist Campus and its shippers in any future negotiations. If Campus and its shippers cannot reach agreements, better data will be available in the event the Commission is required to make a decision regarding Campus’ tolls in the future. The Commission expects that in the longer term, with the guidance and direction set out in this decision, the accounting and reporting requirements and the sharing of information, the pipeline and shippers can return to a cooperative relationship marked by transparency and resulting in tolls and terms of service that are accepted by the market. 4. Interruptible Transportation Tolls 4.1 IT tolls Views of Campus Campus proposed to increase its IT tolls on the Pipeline from $0.1815/GJ to $0.32/GJ for IT service. Campus also requested the Commission grant Campus the discretion to post a revised IT toll from time to time based on Campus’ assessment of prevailing market conditions, in an amount equal to or less than the proposed IT toll. Campus stated that the markets have evolved over the last 20 years. Throughput on the Pipeline has declined steadily since 2006, with a return to 2017 levels after a temporary uptick in 2018 and 2019.32 As of June 2020, there were only two firm service shippers on the                                                 31 See Condition No. 2 in Appendix II. 32 Campus Final Argument, at 6-7 of 53, C10422-2 which also references Campus evidence.  https://docs2.cer-rec.gc.ca/ll-eng/llisapi.dll/fetch/2000/90465/92837/3827917/3908276/4017810/4031892/C10422-2_Campus_-_Final_Argument_for_North_Suffield_Pipeline_Toll_Application%2C_December_15%2C_2020_-_A7L7V5.pdf?nodeid=4031336&vernum=-2 Letter Decision Page 20 of 32 Suffield System, and only one of them shipped gas on the Pipeline. That shipper has a declining volume commitment under the final years of its contract, with the majority of those volumes to be shipped on the South Suffield Pipeline. Campus’ shippers have indicated a preference for shorter-term firm contracts of one to five years, and for interruptible service as the gas supply available in the area served by the Suffield System is declining. The Pipeline has averaged only 35 per cent utilization over 2018 through mid-2020, with the majority of volumes increasingly shipped on an interruptible basis. This virtually guarantees to IT shippers that any IT volumes they nominate will be transported without interruption. Campus stated that it is attempting to remain competitive with NGTL, with whom it competes for volumes. Discretionary IT tolls will allow Campus to improve its flexibility to adapt to the constantly changing dynamics of today’s market for natural gas transportation in the region it operates. Campus needs this ability to manage its risks and compete in today’s environment. Campus referred to RH-003-2011, which provided the ability for TCPL to use discretionary pricing for interruptible services, and said market forces should be met with market solutions that can help to ensure the pipeline remains viable. Citing the same decision, Campus submitted that to require it to provide service on cost of service based tolls would “be an inefficient and non-sensical outcome” and would result in tolls that Campus could not charge in the market. In response to a proposed condition the Commission provided to parties for comment, Campus had no objection to providing traffic data to the CER. However, it noted that some or all of that data may have some commercial sensitivity, and so if this condition were imposed, Campus would reserve the right to request that it be permitted to file some or all of this data on a confidential basis. Views of the Complainants The Complainants believe that a ten per cent premium on the Complainant-calculated cost of service toll is appropriate. This aligns with the premium previously charged by AltaGas for IT service compared to its shortest-term toll, as well as the premium charged for IT service on the NGTL System. The Complainants provided NGTL toll data showing that the IT receipt toll at NGTL Princess is $0.134/GJ and the IT delivery toll is $0.205/GJ at Empress, which is the NGTL path that provides similar service to the Pipeline. The Complainants submitted that a higher IT premium would drive excess return for the Pipeline relative to a reasonable return as determined by an appropriately applied cost of service methodology. While it may discourage a shipper with true firm requirements from using interruptible service, it would also discourage interruptible use by shippers with true interruptible requirements. The Complainants argued that requiring Campus to file traffic data would be helpful to all parties, particularly in the event variable IT pricing is adopted, since it would assist in the assessment of the effectiveness of price signals in attracting incremental volumes to the system. If toll pricing, particularly IT toll prices, fail to attract volumes to the system, the Complainants suggested it may be appropriate for the Commission to adjust any IT toll range it sets in this proceeding rather than requiring shippers to incur the considerable expense and the considerable delay involved in a formal toll complaint process.  Letter Decision Page 21 of 32 Rockpoint submitted that it connected its Suffield gas storage facility to the Pipeline to provide the option of delivering gas to either the AECO/NIT market via NGTL or to Burstall via the Pipeline when gas is being withdrawn from storage. Rockpoint submitted that its connection to the Pipeline cost $1.1 million and became operational on 29 January 2019. Rockpoint delivered volumes to Campus for a total of 33 days in 2019. After Campus’ termination of its TSA, Rockpoint did not deliver to the Pipeline. Pine Cliff submitted that it entered into a service agreement with Campus in 2018 so it would have the option of using NGTL or using a third party pipeline to access the Pipeline. Pine Cliff entered a firm contract with the third party pipeline for 2018 and 2019 and shipped on the Pipeline every day of 2018 and 2019. Pine Cliff agreed to Campus’ new terms because Pine Cliff needed to meet commitments under its agreement with the other pipeline. When that agreement expired, Pine Cliff stopped using the Pipeline. Torxen submitted that it has used the Pipeline every day since December 2017 when it acquired assets from another company. Torxen’s Tide Lake, Princess West and Princess East facilities only have the ability to deliver varying volumes to the Pipeline. In April 2019, the Bantry facility was connected to the Pipeline at a cost of $3.51 million dollars. As of May 2020, the vast majority of Torxen’s sales volumes flow to NGTL and only the gas for which Torxen has no alternative option is being sent to the Pipeline. Views of the Commission When considering the relative value of services a pipeline offers, the Commission considers many factors such as the priority, availability and reliability of the service; the level of commitment required from the shipper; and flexibility or other desirable attributes provided by the service. The Commission finds that granting Campus the discretion to set tolls for IT service at $0.32/GJ or lower will provide Campus with the ability to respond to market circumstances and manage risks on the Pipeline. Campus referenced the context of RH-003-2011 in its application and the Commission asked about potential comparisons to RH-003-2011 in an IR. In that decision, TCPL was granted pricing discretion for IT service and the NEB stated: In the current circumstances of underutilization, users of discretionary services receive virtually guaranteed service whenever they need it, but pay for only a portion of the annual costs of the capacity, making it difficult for TransCanada to recover the costs of that capacity. In our view, allowing TransCanada to charge higher tolls for discretionary services will provide it with a better opportunity to recover the costs of that capacity from those who use it, during the period of time in which it is used.33 In RH-003-2011 portions of the Mainline were underutilized, as is the North Suffield Pipeline. IT shippers both here and in RH-003-2011 received virtually guaranteed access. The Commission assigns moderate weight to this comparison by Campus.34 The Commission similarly finds in this case that higher discretionary tolls are appropriate. Granting Campus                                                 33 NEB Reasons for Decision, - TransCanada PipeLines Limited, NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd., and Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd., RH-003-2011, March 2013, at 126 of 257. 34 The Complainants are correct to point out that paragraph 75 of the Campus written argument gets into detail from RH-003-2011 that goes beyond the detail useful in an analogy to a past precedent. As a result, this submission at paragraph 75 was given low weight.  https://docs2.cer-rec.gc.ca/ll-eng/llisapi.dll/fetch/2000/90465/92833/92843/665035/711778/941262/939799/A51040-1_NEB_-_Reasons_for_Decision_-_TransCanada%2C_NOVA_Gas_and_Foothills_-_2012_and_2013_Final_Tolls_-_RH-003-2011.pdf?nodeid=939800&vernum=-2 Letter Decision Page 22 of 32 the ability to charge discretionary tolls for IT service will provide Campus with a greater opportunity to recover the costs of the Pipeline. The Commission was not persuaded by the Complainants’ arguments regarding price uncertainty. Shippers seeking certainty may contract for firm service. Campus’ introduction of a two year term for firm service is less onerous than the previous minimum of five years. Shippers may elect to contract for firm service and pay the annual costs related to the capacity they need. Shippers who sign up for firm service that grants rights to ITp service can also exercise those rights for variable volumes. Alternatively, shippers may find features of the IT services more attractive and accept the risk that at certain times of the year they may have to choose between paying high discretionary tolls or not using the pipeline. The Commission accepts the proposed maximum IT toll of $0.32/GJ is competitive with full-path NGTL service to Empress. However, NGTL can be used in many different ways to meet the needs of different shippers. Campus does not only need to compete with the full path (receipt plus delivery) tolls on NGTL, it needs to compete with receipt only service, with delivery only service, with the secondary market, and with various combinations of those factors. As Campus has acknowledged, to effectively manage its risk it will need to set IT tolls lower than $0.32/GJ to respond to ever-changing market dynamics and the different services and markets available through NGTL. As Campus is at risk for underutilization of the pipeline, it is incented to set tolls which make its pipeline attractive to potential shippers in order to maximize earnings. The maximum IT toll is known, and shippers may use that toll for planning purposes. There is a possibility of a lower toll depending on market conditions. In setting prices for IT service, Campus will implicitly be capped by tolls for FT and ITp service, tolls for various services on NGTL, and by competition from the secondary market. While the Commission acknowledges the Complainants’ argument that the previous AltaGas rate for IT tolls remains more appropriate than the Campus IT toll at $0.32/GJ or lower, the Complainants did not acquire a right to indefinitely be offered an IT toll that had only a modest premium compared to FT tolls. For all the above reasons, the Commission finds that a market-responsive IT toll at $0.32/GJ or lower is just and reasonable. By 29 April 2021, Campus must submit to the CER, for Commission approval, a method for communicating interruptible tolls to its shippers based on industry best practices. That submission should include a summary of consultations with interested parties, any outstanding concerns, and Campus’ attempts to address them. Current shippers, interested parties and the Complainants should all be served with this filing. Campus may begin charging the approved tolls on 1 May 2021. As this Pipeline continues to be regulated on a Group 2 basis, shippers always have the right to file an appropriately detailed complaint. The Commission has already directed Campus to file with the CER a revised tariff. The tariff should include the method by which IT tolls will be posted. For clarity, Campus is not required to file these tolls with the CER unless Campus wishes to change the cap of $0.32/GJ. The Commission directs Campus to file traffic data at key points on its system pursuant to Guide BB of the CER’s Filing Manual. The data should be as detailed as possible without compromising confidentiality. The data will be publically posted on the CER’s website so interested parties may access it, therefore filing confidential data would not be appropriate in these circumstances. Campus may work with CER staff to determine the key points for which traffic data should be reported. Campus may also discuss with its shippers any aggregation  Letter Decision Page 23 of 32 that may be necessary, for example, aggregating data for the entire Suffield system or aggregating data seasonally or annually. 4.2 Interim IT tolls Views of Campus On 27 June 2019, the NEB ordered that the Pipeline’s tolls be made interim effective 1 July 2019. Campus requested an Order from the Commission directing shippers who have received new firm or interruptible service on the Pipeline since 1 July 2019 to pay to Campus the difference between the interim tolls and the tolls payable under the Revised Tolls and Tariff for the interim period. Campus also requested the discretion to post a revised IT toll from time to time based on Campus’s assessment of prevailing market conditions, in an amount equal to or less than the IT toll proposed in the Revised Toll and Tariff. Campus also submitted that it removed the Annual Increase of Tolls and Charges notice because it desires the flexibility to adjust its IT tolls on a monthly basis in response to prevailing market conditions. Campus submitted an illustrative monthly market-based Suffield System toll calculation to illustrate how it could use its discretion to decrease the IT toll in response to market conditions. Specifically, Campus showed the receipt and delivery tolls on NGTL along with the Empress transport day ahead index which is a secondary market that provides transportation from NIT to Empress and therefore competes with the Pipeline. Campus submitted that from July 2019 through November 2020 it would have hypothetically set IT tolls at $0.32/GJ for three months; at $0.18, $0.20 and $0.15/GJ for one month each; at $0.13/GJ for five months; and at $0.12/GJ for six months. Campus clarified that it was not requesting the Commission impose tolls on the interim period consistent with these illustrative tolls. However, Campus noted the Commission has the authority to have reference to the entirety of the evidence on the record in determining the relief to be granted. In oral argument, Campus stated that it never had discretion to change tolls over the period covered in the illustrative example. It stated that it relies on Appendix A of its application for relief in respect of interim tolls. The IT toll listed in Appendix A is $0.32/GJ. Views of the Complainants The Complainants submitted that their calculated cost of service tolls are just and reasonable and are reflective of Campus' cost of service during the interim period and prospectively. The Complainants requested these tolls should be made final for the interim period. The Complainants submitted that Campus' behaviour throughout the proceeding delayed the setting of final tolls. The Complainants were also concerned that Campus circumvented the 15-month advance notice requirement of any toll increase set out in the then-existing contracts and made misrepresentations to the NEB at the time of the transfer application. The Complainants submitted that in these circumstances, Campus should not be permitted to benefit from its misconduct in the finalization of interim tolls, and that any increases should only operate prospectively. The Complainants also submitted that because Campus' actions resulted in reduction in use of the Pipeline, Campus should be required to return carrying costs during the interim period. The Complainants submitted that refunds and carrying costs should be calculated for the interim period and provided to shippers. In the alternative, the Complainants request that the Commission set the tolls for a period of 15 months from the date of the Commission's toll order, which is equivalent to the toll change notice period that  Letter Decision Page 24 of 32 the Complainants negotiated in their TSAs with AltaGas. In essence, this would simply be holding Campus to the bargain struck in the TSAs. Views of the Commission Given that the Commission made an interim order regarding tolls, pursuant to section 232 of the CER Act, the Commission may make an order directing the pipeline company to refund or recover tolls in the manner the Commission deems to be appropriate. Typically if the final tolls found to be just and reasonable are higher than the toll set in the interim toll order there would be a recovery, and if final tolls are lower there would be a refund. The Commission has not approved Campus’ or the Complainants’ proposed tolls, but has instead approved a range of IT rates which may be set at $0.32/GJ or less based on market conditions. This discretion was approved along with an alternative to contract for FT service on reasonable terms with just and reasonable tolls. When Campus proposed an IT toll of $0.32/GJ and tolls were made interim, the Complainants stopped moving IT volumes through contracts with Campus to the extent possible, even despite some recent capital investments to connect to the Suffield System. The Complainants were also unwilling to contract for FT service at the toll level and terms proposed by Campus. The Commission expects that if Campus had been granted pricing discretion with a range of $0.32/GJ or less during this time period, Campus would have adjusted its IT tolls to meet the market and attract additional throughput to its pipeline. It is possible that Campus would have kept its IT tolls at the maximum of $0.32/GJ even as throughput continued to decline and IT traffic dwindled, but this would have been inconsistent with Campus’ submissions that it is competing with the NGTL pipeline system. The Complainants may have elected to contract for FT service if the tolls were in the range approved by the Commission in this decision, along with reasonable terms and conditions. However, this alternative was not available to the Complainants during the interim toll period. The Commission is not aware of a discretionary toll being approved retroactively, and the parties in the proceeding did not provide sufficient evidence for the Commission to determine the discretionary toll levels over the interim period. The interim toll for IT service was $0.1815/GJ. Without knowing the market-responsive IT tolls that would have been set in the interim period, the Commission finds it impossible to calculate refunds or recoveries. The Commission notes that over the interim toll period, the simple average of the illustrative IT tolls provided by Campus is $0.168 cents. The interim toll of $0.1815/GJ is slightly higher than the simple average of the illustrative tolls filed by Campus and is in the approved range of IT tolls of $0.32/GJ or less. Factoring in all this information and in considering that Campus had the overall onus to support its position on this issue, the Commission makes the interim IT tolls final for the period of 1 July 2019 to 30 April 2021. The end result is that Campus did not meet its onus with respect to its request for an interim toll refund. For clarity, the Commission is ordering Campus not to refund or recover any part of the IT tolls charged under the interim order. The Commission declines the Complainants’ request to base this lack of recovery on conduct by Campus. The Commission also declines to assess carrying charges against Campus. The Commission has already provided the direction above to Campus on the concerns raised by the Complainants. The Complainants did not cite authority for their proposal to base a lack of recovery or carrying charges on conduct by Campus.  Letter Decision Page 25 of 32 5. Terms and Conditions 5.1 Billing date Views of Campus Campus proposed to change the billing date in Article 7.2(a) of its general terms and conditions. Instead of billing on or before the 20th of each month, Campus proposes to bill “on or before the Day succeeding the Alberta Energy Regulator Volumetric Data and Waste Management Reporting Deadline of each Month” (the “AER reporting date”). Campus submitted that the AER reporting date is an industry standard date well known to current and prospective Suffield System shippers. Tethering the billing date to the AER reporting date ensures that Campus’ billing cycle will be in line with other important industry dates, and will automatically adjust if the AER reporting date is changed in the future. Views of the Complainants The Complainants did not object to this change. Views of the Commission The Commission approves the proposed change in Campus’ billing cycle to align with industry standards. 5.2 Abandonment funding Views of Campus In its 5 June 2019 revised toll filing with the NEB, Campus proposed to collect a $0.02 abandonment fee in addition to its revised tolls. On 20 September 2019, Campus filed further revised firm service tolls that no longer included any abandonment fee. Campus also no longer intended to collect the proposed abandonment fee on IT service. Campus submitted that it is self-funding the abandonment liabilities for the Suffield System, which obligation is secured by a surety bond posted with the CER. Views of the Complainants Rockpoint originally objected to the $0.02 abandonment fee proposed by Campus in its 5 June 2019 toll filing on the basis that the surety bond in place already covered abandonment costs. Further, Rockpoint said Campus had not obtained approval from the NEB to charge an abandonment fee, or otherwise provided information to shippers to explain the abandonment fee. Campus also proposed to increase the abandonment fee each year to account for inflation. Rockpoint had concerns with this since abandonment obligations are calculated on a net present value-basis and, per MH-001-201335, all abandonment surcharges collected from shippers must be put into a trust that is expected to earn a certain return which would be realized by the trust. As noted in the Application, Campus is no longer proposing to collect an abandonment fee as part of its ""market-based tolls"".                                                 35 NEB Reasons for Decision – Set-aside and collection mechanisms, MH-001-2013, May 2014 A60676. https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/Item/View/2478727 Letter Decision Page 26 of 32 Views of the Commission Campus is using a surety bond to fund its abandonment funding obligation. The annual cost of this surety bond has been included in all cost of service toll calculations so abandonment funding costs do not need to be dealt with further in this proceeding. All pipeline companies must comply with MH-001-2013 and all past direction from the NEB and present and future direction from the Commission. As a company using a set aside mechanism other than a trust, Campus must file Appendix XVI of MH-001-2013 with the CER by 31 January each year and must provide an update on the status of the Pipeline. This includes any changes in cost estimates, or other components that could prompt material changes in plans to fund abandonment. The Commission directs Campus to provide an estimate of the timing of the abandonment of its facility as well as any supporting information with regards to these estimates at the time of the next Set Aside and Collection Mechanism Review. 5.3 Annual Toll Increase Views of Campus Campus submitted that it removed the Annual Increase of Tolls and Charges notice because it desires the flexibility to adjust its IT tolls on a monthly basis in response to prevailing market conditions. Campus noted that from a practical perspective an enhanced notice provision would have most relevance to any proposed increase to the IT toll cap because firm tolls will be locked in for the duration of their term. Campus does not object to being required to provide additional notice to its shippers of any proposed changes to its tolls or charges beyond filing those changes with the CER - for instance, being required to send a copy of all changed tolls and charges to all shippers, regardless of whether or not it might immediately affect them; posting tolls on its website; or both. However, Campus believes it should continue to operate and be regulated on a complaint basis as a Group 2 company. Campus suggested that a 30-day notice period would be consistent with the continued inclusion of a 30-day termination clause in the TSA and might be reasonable. Alternately, a notice period tethered to bi-annual toll changes made on the NGTL system could be reasonable in the circumstances of the competitive market dynamic. Views of the Complainants The Complainants were concerned that removal of the notice provision would also allow Campus to adjust firm service tolls on a monthly basis, which would be a further disincentive for parties to contract for firm service. Without an adequate notice provision for adjustment of tolls in a TSA, a shipper would have no certainty with respect to the tolls it would be paying on the Pipeline in any given month. Further, as a Group 2 company, Campus need only file updated tolls with the CER in order to effect toll changes. This would likely lead to disputes between Campus and its shippers, including further complaints, which is contrary to regulatory efficiency. The Complainants requested that the 15-month notice provision, or a similarly reasonable notice provision not less than 12 months, be included in the TSA.  Letter Decision Page 27 of 32 Views of the Commission The Commission has approved an IT toll of $0.32 or lower. Campus may set IT tolls at any price within this range and such changes would not be considered a toll increase. As discussed in section 4.1, Campus must submit to the CER, for Commission approval, a method for communicating interruptible tolls based on industry best practices. That submission should include a summary of consultations with interested parties, any outstanding concerns, and Campus’ attempts to address them. The Commission does not accept that approval of discretionary tolls within a specified range necessitates removing notice requirements for increases in tolls outside of that range. The Complainants’ concern about adjustments to firm tolls on a monthly basis has been addressed by Campus’ commitment to keep FT tolls consistent for the length of any FT contract that may be entered into. If Campus wants to change tolls for future FT contracts, or change IT tolls outside of the approved range, the Commission requires Campus to provide notice to shippers as discussed in section 3. The Commission notes that Campus did not object to inclusion of a notice period, and recommended the notice period be 30 days, or on bi-annual dates. The Commission approves modifying the existing notice period to three months as discussed in that section. The Commission is of the view that this would provide Campus time to consult with interested parties. It would also provide shippers with the opportunity to obtain additional information from Campus about the basis for the proposed tolls, attempt to resolve any concerns, and file a complaint with the CER, if required. The Commission has already directed Campus to file a revised tariff with the CER. The tariff should include the notice period for modifying tolls. Predictability and stability are desirable attributes of tolls. Therefore the Commission encourages Campus to post IT tolls as far in advance as practically possible, while balancing the need to be responsive to market forces. The Commission expects Campus and interested parties to work together to determine an appropriate balancing of interests. 5.4 Interruptible Preferred Service  Views of Campus Campus introduced ITp which has priority over regular IT service but not firm service volumes. Campus introduced ITp in response to shipper feedback requesting firm service that includes flexibility while still incorporating priority of service. Campus submitted that the intent of this service is to provide firm service shippers transportation service that has priority over IT service at an amount below the IT toll with no additional minimum quantity obligation. ITp allows shippers that subscribe for firm service to ship a certain percentage of their firm service volumes on a priority interruptible basis at a $0.02 premium over the shipper’s applicable firm service toll as shown in the table below. FT Term  ITp Firm Capacity Portion ITp Toll (Term toll + $0.02) 2 years 40% $0.26/GJ 5 years 50% $0.24/GJ 10 years 100% $0.23/GJ 20 years 300% $0.22/GJ   Letter Decision Page 28 of 32 ITp service features are meant to provide firm service shippers with greater operational flexibility and therefore incent shippers to subscribe for firm service on the Suffield System. In turn, this would provide the potential for longer-term throughput stability and revenue for the system. Campus submitted that any volumes shipped through ITp service result in a cost savings to firm service shippers relative to the IT tolls they would otherwise incur to ship such volumes and the difference in pricing is associated with the term commitment of firm service shippers compared to the lack thereof for interruptible service shippers. Campus provided daily average annual throughput data on the Pipeline from 2017 to 2019. These data show that firm throughput steadily declined and interruptible throughput steadily increased. Campus explained that IPC, a shipper under a legacy agreement, has a renewable 20-year firm-service contract which expires on 31 December 2022, and is renewable for successive one-year terms thereafter. Views of the Complainants The Complainants objected to the adoption of ITp service on the Pipeline as it would further erode the value of IT service. The Complainants submitted that if the Commission were to approve ITp service, IT tolls should be set lower than ITp tolls in order to reflect the latter's higher priority of service. The Complainants argued that the introduction of ITp service represents a material change in the service offered on the Pipeline. This is particularly the case for IT service shippers, who will be prejudiced in their ability to utilize the Pipeline by the new priority service. In the Complainants' view, Campus did not justify the need to offer ITp service and should not be permitted to do so. Views of the Commission The Commission encourages its regulated companies to consult with interested parties and explore innovative ways to find market solutions.36 The Commission has taken into consideration that FT throughput on the Pipeline has been declining and encourages Campus’ attempts to respond to shipper feedback and introduce flexible new services. The Commission accepts Campus’ assertion that ITp service features provide firm service shippers with greater operational flexibility and may incent shippers to subscribe for firm service. Accordingly, the Commission approves ITp service on the Pipeline at an amount corresponding with the shipper’s FT service toll plus $0.02. Campus focused on the commitment required by shippers in the form of FT service contracts, with longer contract terms required to obtain greater portions of ITp service. Campus also noted that ITp being a feature of FT contracts makes FT contracts more desirable. The Commission finds that these factors support ITp having a lower price than IT service.                                                 36 This is consistent with NEB, Reasons for Decision - NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd – MH-031-2017, North Montney Mainline Variance GC-125, May 2018 at 41.  Letter Decision Page 29 of 32 The Complainants focused on the higher priority of this service and submitted that ITp should therefore be charged at a higher amount compared to IT service. The Commission finds that the Complainants’ position fails to sufficiently account for the commitment required in order to qualify for ITp service. Although Campus stated that ITp would be priced at an amount lower than the IT service toll, this may not always be the case, as the Commission has given Campus the discretion to lower the IT toll when market conditions warrant. The Commission notes that shippers with FT service would have the choice of using IT service or ITp service in circumstances where the IT tolls may be lower than the corresponding ITp toll. 5.5 Failure of Supply and Market Views of Campus Campus amended the general terms and conditions regarding the price at which the transporter will sell gas to or buy gas from the customer in the event of a discrepancy between a customer’s receipts and deliveries on the system. Given that shippers are the most knowledgeable about their gas supply and downstream demand, and given that the customer has the obligation to balance its quantity of gas, Campus believes it is reasonable for shippers to bear the risk of their receipt and delivery volumes falling out of balance. Previously, Article 5.4 of the general terms and conditions stated the transporter could charge the customer “130% of [transporter’s] highest cost of gas on that day” if the customer’s deliveries on the system exceeded its receipts. Now Article 5.4 provides that the customer will be charged “the highest price transacted at the AECO/NIT index published by CGPR plus the higher of the Empress transportation tariff published by TCPL and the Empress – AECO/NIT market differential published by CGPR on that Day…” to balance the customer’s account. Article 5.5 of the general terms and conditions previously provided that the transporter could purchase gas from the customer at “seventy (70%) percent of [transporter’s] lowest purchase of gas on that day” if the customer’s receipts exceed its deliveries on the system. Now Article 5.5 provides that the transporter “will purchase from the customer at the lowest price transacted at the AECO/NIT index published by CGPR less the lower of the Empress transportation tariff published by TCPL and the Empress – AECO/NIT market differential published by CGPR on that Day…” to balance the customer’s account. Campus submitted that specifying the AECO/NIT index as the benchmark for the gas price is reasonable, based on a readily identifiable market price and provides added clarity for both Campus and its shippers. The Empress tariff or differential is representative of downstream markets that Campus’ shippers have access to using the Suffield System. Views of the Complainants The Complainants submitted that the proposed pricing mechanisms appear to heavily favour the transporter and may be considered punitive. This represents a significant and unwarranted shift in risk to the shipper. Further, the articles of the general terms and conditions do not clearly contemplate or outline the interplay between upstream/downstream force majeure events on interconnected pipelines that may impact supply or delivery on the system and that are beyond the control of the shipper. If no relief is provided to a shipper in such cases, while the transporter is insulated from associated risks pursuant to Article 5.7, there may arise an unreasonable imbalance in the TSA.  Letter Decision Page 30 of 32 The Complainants requested that the pricing mechanisms in Articles 5.4 and 5.5 from the AltaGas TSA be reinserted, and that Campus include language to clarify the nature of the obligations where there are upstream/downstream force majeure events on interconnected pipelines. The Complainants submitted they are concerned that Campus is proposing to ensure that shippers assume the total risk of supply or market failures, and that Campus is completely insulated from such risks. The Complainants’ position is not that Campus assume all risks of such force majeure events, but that a sharing of those risks between the carrier and shippers would be just and reasonable. This is particularly the case where the pricing mechanisms in Articles 5.4 and 5.5 heavily favour Campus and are punitive to a shipper. Views of the Commission The Commission does not approve the proposed changes to the wording in Articles 5.4 and 5.5 of the TSA and instructs Campus to revert to the previous provisions. The Commission acknowledges that it is reasonable for shippers to bear the risk of their receipt and delivery volumes falling out of balance as they are the ones who tender volumes and determine the receipt and delivery points for their tendered gas. Where a shipper fails to ensure this balance, it is reasonable for the pipeline to be compensated for the costs of the actions it must take to ensure its pipeline system continues to operate within normal parameters. It may also be appropriate for these provisions to provide a disincentive for this behavior. However, Campus did not provide any evidence that failure of supply or market has become problematic, nor that greater disincentives are required. The Commission agrees with the Complainants that upstream/downstream force majeure events on interconnected pipelines may impact supply or delivery on the system and are beyond the control of the shipper. This should not create an opportunity for the pipeline to earn excessive profits. The Commission notes that the previous provisions contained a 30 per cent premium on the cost of gas purchased in the event of failure of supply and a 30 per cent discount on the cost of gas in the event of failure of market. In both cases these costs were related to gas that was actually purchased by the transporter, whereas the proposed provisions seek to link the costs to the most extreme (highest or lowest priced) transactions on the AECO/NIT index. Campus did not provide any evidence of how these extreme transactions are relevant to the costs actually incurred by the Pipeline to balance its receipts and deliveries or otherwise provide appropriate justification for the proposed changes. 5.6 Testing of Measuring Equipment Views of Campus Campus revised Article 4.3 of its general terms and conditions to require that the shipper, rather than the transporter, bear the costs of conducting standardized testing to ensure the accuracy of measurement equipment at the shipper’s receipt and delivery points. Campus submitted that it implemented this change because many Suffield System shippers own the measurement equipment at their receipt points and it is reasonable for shippers to bear the costs of ensuring the accuracy of their own measurement equipment. For shippers relying on Campus’ measurement equipment, Campus believes requiring these shippers to pay for periodic testing is reasonable compared to the alternative of Campus requiring such shippers to install and maintain their own measurement equipment. Under a market-based toll regime where Campus is not assured the recovery of its invested capital or costs of operation,  Letter Decision Page 31 of 32 Campus believes it should be permitted to enter into commercial arrangements with its shippers that allocate costs and risks as mutually agreed. Campus explained that its approval of tests and methods is required to ensure consistency across the transmission system and ensure the standards meet regulatory requirements. Given the tests and methods for verifying the accuracy of measuring equipment previously required transporter approval, this change was made to simplify the agreement. The shipper still has the right to exceed the transporter’s requirements to meet their own should they so choose. Campus does not believe there has been a material shift in risk to the shippers as a result of this change. Campus stated that it maintains and completes much of the calibration and testing on the legacy devices at receipt points but has been shifting the responsibility with many of the new tie-ins to the customer given they already have and maintain meters. This was done to keep the tie-in and ongoing maintenance costs as low as possible. Campus also submitted that the change in frequency from three months to 90 days was not material and there is a provision to change this upon the reasonable request of either party. Campus estimated that the cost for instrumentation, testing and analysis would be $78,000.00 for 2020 for the entire Suffield System and these costs were included in Campus’ illustrative cost of service tolls. Views of the Complainants The Complainants observed that with the proposed change, the expense of testing measuring equipment has been moved from the transporter to the shipper in all cases. The Complainants submitted that the fact that some shippers may own the measuring equipment does not justify the proposed shift of costs. The Complainants requested that Campus revert to the language from the AltaGas TSA in Article 4.3. Pursuant to the change, the shipper will be responsible for the costs of all tests of measuring equipment, regardless of whether such tests are requested by the shipper. Under the AltaGas TSA, the transporter bore the costs of tests of measuring equipment, except where a shipper-requested test showed an inaccuracy of less than two per cent (in which case, it was the shipper’s expense). The Complainants submitted that this is appropriate, as the transporter should be expected to pay the expense of ensuring the integrity of its system, including in relation to measurement of gas, while still holding a shipper accountable if a potentially unnecessary test has been requested. Views of the Commission The Commission generally accepts Campus’ position that it should be permitted to enter into commercial arrangements with its shippers that allocate costs and risks as mutually agreed. The Commission notes that the Complainants, who were all shippers, do not agree to this shifting of costs. Campus did not provide evidence of the proportion of measuring equipment owned by Campus versus its shippers, the proportion of the costs of testing that is currently paid for by Campus versus its shippers, nor data on how these arrangements have changed over time. As discussed in section 4.1, shippers on the Pipeline have already constructed interconnecting equipment. In the interest of transparency and regulatory certainty, the Commission would not approve a change to an existing commercial agreement in the absence of compelling evidence. Campus did not provide evidence of why its proposed change would result in a better outcome. Therefore the Commission does not approve the proposal for shippers to pay for all costs of testing at this time.  Letter Decision Page 32 of 32 6.

RECITALS 1.1 Enbridge is a body corporate continued under the laws of Canada, having its registered office in the City of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta.  Enbridge owns and operates those assets set forth in Schedule “A” (the “Canadian Mainline”), a common carrier pipeline system regulated under the National Energy Board Act. 1.2 Enbridge Energy Limited Partnership owns and operates those assets set forth in Schedule “B” (the “Lakehead System”), a pipeline system regulated by the FERC. 1.3 Together the Canadian Mainline and the Lakehead System comprise the “Enbridge Mainline”. 1.4 CAPP represents companies large and small, that explore for, develop, and produce natural gas and crude oil throughout Canada.  1.5 The CTS was negotiated by representatives from Enbridge, CAPP and from Shippers of Record that delivered the majority of the volumes of liquid hydrocarbons on the Enbridge Mainline in 2010 (the “2011 Negotiating Team”) and where the context requires, reference to the “2011 Negotiating Team” includes Enbridge, CAPP and such Shippers of Record. 1.6 The CTS provides for an international joint toll for all hydrocarbons shipped from Western Canadian Receipt Points on the Canadian Mainline to delivery points on the Lakehead System and  to delivery points on the Canadian Mainline located downstream of the Lakehead System during the Term. The CTS also establishes the local tolls for transportation services solely within Canada, from receipt points on the Canadian Mainline to delivery points on the Canadian Mainline through the Canadian Local Toll.  Transportation and related services solely within the U.S., from receipt points on the Lakehead System to delivery points on the Lakehead System, will continue to be governed by the FERC Tariff Rates.     (2) 1.7 The Enbridge Board of Directors and the CAPP Board of Governors have approved the principles that comprise the CTS. 2. PRINCIPLES 2.1 No one element of the CTS is to be considered as acceptable to any party in isolation from all other aspects of this settlement.  The parties intend that the CTS be viewed as a whole, reflecting the allocation of risks and rewards between Enbridge and its Shippers over the Term. 2.2 The 2011 Negotiating Team agrees that the CTS, including the rate principles set forth herein, are the result of good faith arm’s length negotiations, which have resulted in an agreement that is believed to be fair and equitable to Enbridge and all Shippers.  Accordingly, each member of the 2011 Negotiating Team has agreed not to, directly or indirectly, commence or support any application, motion or other proceeding before an applicable regulator for the purpose of asking such regulator to set rates for the Enbridge Mainline during the Term which are inconsistent with the rate design and rates contemplated by the CTS, unless otherwise provided hereunder.  For clarity, neither the foregoing, nor anything else in this CTS, is intended to, and shall not, be construed as a waiver of any parties’ right to complain, protest or otherwise dispute any agreement that may be reached between Enbridge and the Representative Shipper Group pursuant to any other matter as set out herein. 2.3 The rate design and rates contained in the CTS will be without prejudice to any positions that may be taken by any party in respect to matters governed by the CTS for periods following expiry or termination of the CTS.  In particular, and without restricting the generality of the above, the 2011 Negotiating Team confirms that the selection of certain capital structures, interest rates, equity returns and operating costs, required for the purposes of implementing the backstopping principles set forth in Article 16 of the CTS, do not in any way form a precedent for the future, nor do these represent the position of either Enbridge or the Shippers as to the capital structure,     (3) interest expense, equity return and operating costs that would be appropriate absent this negotiated settlement. 2.4 The 2011 Negotiating Team intends that the principles set forth in the CTS will be applicable solely to the Enbridge Mainline during the Term and will not form a precedent. 2.5 There will be no priority access on the Enbridge Mainline during the Term. 2.6 Subject to Section 7.2, the existing U.S. Agreements in effect as of June 30, 2011 will not be impacted by the CTS during the Term.  Moreover, the tolls and tariffs on file with FERC and in effect from time to time pursuant to such U.S. Agreements shall not apply to hydrocarbons transported on the Canadian Mainline or under the IJT unless otherwise agreed between Enbridge and the Representative Shipper Group.  2.7 For clarity, the CTS does not provide for an international joint tariff for hydrocarbons shipped from receipts points on the Lakehead System to delivery points on the Canadian Mainline.  However, nothing in the CTS precludes Enbridge from offering additional joint tariffs.     (4) PART II – INTERPRETATION 3.

(13) PART III – TERM AND APPLICABILITY 5. TERM OF SETTLEMENT  5.1 The term of the CTS will commence July 1, 2011 and terminate on June 30, 2021 (the “Term”), unless terminated earlier hereunder or extended pursuant to Section 5.2.  The CTS will replace the 2011 ITS, effective as of the start of the Term. 5.2 The Term may be extended by mutual agreement of Enbridge and the 2021 Negotiating Team, provided that such extension shall be for a period of no less than 1 year. 6. APPLICABILITY OF CTS vs. CANADIAN AGREEMENTS 6.1 During the Term, the CTS will supersede the Canadian Agreements, provided however that any calculations that would otherwise have been made pursuant to the Canadian Agreements will be deemed to have been made during the Term. 6.2 Upon the termination or expiry of the CTS, any of the Canadian Agreements that have not expired or terminated will come back into effect as of the date of termination or expiry of the CTS.  Any toll and other adjustments that are permitted in the Canadian Agreements shall continue thereafter for their respective then remaining terms.  For clarity, the terms under any of the Canadian Agreements shall be deemed to have been applicable during the Term and shall continue to apply thereafter.  The assets under the Canadian Agreements will be included in the Canadian Mainline at their remaining undepreciated costs.  An illustrative example is set forth in Schedule “J”. 6.3 Notwithstanding this Article 6, CAPP preserves the audit rights pursuant to the terms of the Alberta Clipper Canada Settlement agreement.     (14) 7. APPLICABILITY OF CTS vs. U.S. AGREEMENTS 7.1 Subject to Section 7.2, the U.S. Agreements will remain in place, and the tariff rates on file with FERC and in effect from time to time pursuant to such U.S. Agreements shall continue to be utilized in calculating the FTR during the Term but neither such tariff rate nor the FTR will apply to hydrocarbons transported under the IJT during the term of the CTS unless otherwise agreed between Enbridge and the Representative Shipper Group pursuant to Section 13.1.  7.2 Where any of the U.S. Agreements expires or terminates during the Term and is replaced by a future agreement and/or settlement for the transportation of hydrocarbons on the Lakehead System, such future agreements and/or settlements will apply in accordance with their respective terms; provided, however, that any tariff rates on file with FERC and in effect from time to time pursuant to such future agreements and/or settlements will not apply to hydrocarbons transported under the IJT unless otherwise agreed between Enbridge and the Representative Shipper Group pursuant to Section 13.1  Any toll and other adjustments that are permitted pursuant to a U.S. Agreement shall continue to be utilized in calculating the FTR during the Term.     (15) PART IV – TOLLS AND RELATED FINANCIAL MATTERS 8. INTERNATIONAL JOINT TOLLS 8.1 Subject to applicable law, effective as of July 1, 2011, tolls for transportation, inclusive of receipt and delivery terminalling services, of hydrocarbons from Western Canada Receipt Points on the Enbridge Mainline to delivery points (i) on the Lakehead System, and (ii) on the Canadian Mainline that are downstream of the Lakehead System are the amounts set forth in Schedule “D” as adjusted pursuant to Section 10.1 (the “International Joint Tariff” or “IJT”).  All IJT tolls are calculated on a distance adjusted basis for transmission and for commodity types, based on and with reference to an initial IJT toll of U.S. $3.85 per barrel for movement of heavy crude oil from Hardisty, Alberta to any of the delivery points in the Chicago, Illinois area (Mokena, Griffith, Lockport).  In addition, the applicable Outstanding Amount Surcharge as provided in Section 11 will also be collected. 9. CANADIAN LOCAL TOLLS 9.1 Subject to applicable law, and approval by the NEB, effective as of July 1, 2011, tolls, inclusive of receipt and delivery terminalling services, for transportation of hydrocarbons solely on the Canadian Mainline are the amounts set forth in Schedule “E” (the “Canadian Local Toll”, or “CLT”).  The CLTs are calculated using the 2011 Interim ITS Tolls as a starting point, adjusted for the Currently Outstanding Adjustment Amounts outlined in Section 11.3 which will be collected through the Outstanding Amount Surcharge.  The CLT is intended to replace the 2011 Interim ITS Tolls as of July 1, 2011.  After July 1, 2011 there will be no further true-up for prior Canadian Mainline tolls. 10. ANNUAL TOLL ADJUSTMENT 10.1 Commencing effective July 1, 2012, the IJT tolls and the CLT shall be adjusted annually, up or down, at a rate equal to 75% of the GDPP Index.      (16) 10.2 The tankage revenue requirement used to determine receipt and delivery tankage fees in Canada in effect on July 1, 2011 will be adjusted annually, up or down, by 75% of the GDPP Index beginning July 1, 2012.  An annual volume forecast will then be used to determine the average tankage fees in effect on July 1 each year and establish the actual receipt and delivery tankage fees in accordance with the Declining Bracket Mechanism.  If the actual revenues collected for receipt and delivery tankage fees are greater than, or less than, what the tankage revenue requirement was for the applicable calendar year, (including differences due to the Declining Bracket Mechanism), then such difference will be used to subtract from or add to, as applicable, the next year’s tankage revenue requirement.  Shippers will be required to pay the applicable receipt and delivery tankage fees for volumes transported under the IJT or the CLT. Notwithstanding the preceding, Enbridge may seek future NEB approval for a different toll design and regulatory treatment for tankage fees with the endorsement of the Representative Shipper Group.   10.3 The CLT from receipt points in Canada to the International Boundary, near Gretna, Manitoba, from the International Boundary, near Sarnia, Ontario to delivery points in Canada and from receipt points in Ontario to the International Boundary, near Chippawa, Ontario will be further adjusted in the event that the sum of the CLT and FTR is not greater than or equal to the IJT tolls in effect in any given year.  Enbridge will file with the NEB an application to adjust only the CLT from receipt points in Canada to the International Boundary near Gretna, Manitoba; from the International Boundary, near Sarnia, Ontario to delivery points in Canada; and from receipt points in Ontario to the International Boundary, near Chippawa, Ontario to ensure that the IJT is maintained in accordance with regulatory requirements. 11. OUTSTANDING AMOUNT SURCHARGE 11.1 A per barrel toll surcharge in the amount set forth in Schedule “F” (the “Outstanding Amount Surcharge”) will be added to the IJT tolls and the CLT for the 24 month period from July 1,     (17) 2011 to June 30, 2013 in order to permit Enbridge to collect Currently Outstanding Adjustment Amounts. The Outstanding Amount Surcharge is $0.067 per barrel for movements of heavy crude oil from Hardisty, Alberta to the U.S. border near Gretna, Manitoba and is adjusted for distance and by commodity-type for all barrels transported in Canada. 11.2 Any of the Currently Outstanding Adjustment Amounts that remain uncollected by Enbridge as of June 30, 2013 shall be immediately due to Enbridge.  Likewise, an over collection of the Currently Outstanding Adjustment Amounts collected through the Outstanding Amount Surcharge as of June 30, 2013 will be immediately due to the Shippers.  For clarity, any under or over collection of the Currently Outstanding Adjustment Amounts as of June 30, 2013 will be recovered or paid by increasing or decreasing, as applicable, the 2014 IJT and CLT tolls effective July 1, 2014 through a one-time surcharge, which adjustment will be on a per barrel basis. The Outstanding Amount Surcharge will be based on a forecast of total sum shipment volume for the IJT and CLT for the calendar year beginning July 1, 2014, which surcharge will be adjusted for distance and by commodity-type for all barrels transported in Canada.  Any under or over collection remaining as of July 1, 2015 will not be collected or refunded.  For clarity, the Currently Outstanding Adjustment Amounts are amounts due to Enbridge as a result of the interim tolls from January 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011.  Any variance relative to the period from April 1, 2011 to June 30, 2011 shall be for Enbridge’s sole account. 11.3 The “Currently Outstanding Adjustment Amounts” total $69.7 million and is comprised of the following: (i) a total of $130.0 million as of December 31, 2010 to recover the remaining 2010 ITS revenue shortfall; (ii) a total of $72.7 million as of March 31, 2011 to credit all applicable net tax loss carry forwards calculated using the applicable 2011 tax rates; and     (18) (iii) a total of $12.4 million to recover amounts due to Enbridge under the 2011 ITS for the toll variance from January 1, 2011 until March 31, 2011.  12. ALLOWANCE OIL 12.1 For transportation under the IJT, Enbridge shall collect in kind a percentage of all hydrocarbons delivered off the Enbridge Mainline in the amount of 1/10th of 1 percent of the volume of hydrocarbons physically delivered under the IJT.  The IJT Allowance Oil will be collected and divided between the Canadian Mainline and the Lakehead System as 1/20th of 1 percent to each carrier. 12.2 For transportation under the CLT, Enbridge shall collect in kind or deduct as Allowance Oil a percentage of all hydrocarbons delivered off the Enbridge Mainline, in the amount of 1/20th of 1 percent of the volume of hydrocarbons physically delivered under the CLT. 12.3 Enbridge shall be permitted, at its discretion, to resell to Shippers the Allowance Oil hydrocarbons collected for transportation under the IJT or CLT at a price determined in accordance with the method described in the following Sections. 12.4 Each month, each Shipper who either: (i) has crude or NGL delivered off the Enbridge Mainline in such month; or (ii) holds an Over/Short Position on the Enbridge Mainline at the end of such month, shall furnish to Enbridge a unit price for each crude and NGL stream delivered or held, as applicable.  For each refined product stream Enbridge will utilize the prices it receives from refined product Shippers for the purpose of balancing delivery of product batches.  Except as provided below, the prices for crude, NGL, and refined product streams so furnished shall be the prices at which Shippers’ Allowance Oil for each hydrocarbon stream tendered to Enbridge by each Shipper shall be resold to each Shipper by Enbridge.     (19) 12.5 In the event a Shipper does not provide a price for any crude or NGL stream, the Allowance Oil value for that Shipper will be deemed to be the simple average of the prices for that crude or NGL stream received by Enbridge from all other Shippers of that crude or NGL stream for the month that the Allowance Oil volume is being collected whose transaction prices have been accepted by Enbridge as reasonable pursuant to Section 12.6. 12.6 Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.4, if the price furnished to Enbridge by any Shipper for any crude or NGL stream is unreasonable, in the sole opinion of Enbridge, acting reasonably, the Allowance Oil resale value for that Shipper for the crude or NGL stream in question shall be the simple average of the prices for that crude or NGL stream received by all other Shippers of that crude or NGL stream for the month whose transaction prices have been accepted by Enbridge as reasonable.  Alternatively, Enbridge may choose to use the average of the monthly prices posted for light sweet crude at Edmonton by Imperial Oil Limited, Shell Canada Ltd., Flint Hills Resources and Suncor Energy Inc., or their respective successors, adjusted for quality, pursuant to industry information determined by Enbridge.  The average of the monthly prices posted for light sweet crude at Edmonton must be based on all posted prices if all are posted, but if not all are posted, based on no less than three posted prices.  In the event that the posted prices cannot be determined in accordance with the above, Enbridge will meet with impacted Shippers to negotiate an appropriate price. 13. CONTINGENT TOLL ADJUSTMENTS 13.1 In addition to those other adjustments described in this Part IV, the IJT and the CLT will be adjusted for the following, subject to NEB approval (each, a “Contingent Toll Adjustment”): (a) any changes in toll methodology that may be agreed to by Enbridge and the Representative Shipper Group;     (20) (b) any incremental tolls resulting from an NEB order in relation to the Land Matters Consultation Initiative;  (c) any Major Enbridge Mainline Expansion Capital as described in Article 16;  (d) any Material Change in Business Circumstances as described in Article 20; and (e) any other changes that are mutually agreed to by Enbridge and the Representative Shipper Group. 13.2 For clarity, if Enbridge and the Representative Shipper Group are unable to reach agreement on the amount of any Contingent Toll Adjustment identified under Section 13.1 (c) or (d), then Enbridge or the Representative Shipper Group may refer the issue of the amount of the Contingent Toll Adjustment to dispute resolution under Article 30. 13.3 If the NEB does not approve any Contingent Toll Adjustment identified under Section 13.1 that has been agreed to by Enbridge and the Representative Shipper Group, then a NEB hearing to determine the amount of such Contingent Toll Adjustment may be requested.     14. TOLL INCENTIVES 14.1 Enbridge may offer toll incentives onto the Enbridge Mainline, provided such toll incentives on the Enbridge Mainline are offered equally to all Shippers to all Enbridge Mainline Receipt & Delivery Points, as adjusted for distance and commodity types.   14.2 “Enbridge Mainline Receipt & Delivery Points” means those receipt and delivery points as set forth in Schedule “A” and Schedule “B” as may be adjusted with the agreement of Enbridge and the Representative Shipper Group. For greater certainty, the IJT tolls applicable to delivery points on the Enbridge Mainline shall be the same, irrespective of the specific facilities or path used to effect such deliveries.      (21) 14.3 “Non Enbridge Mainline Receipt & Delivery Points” means any receipt or delivery points that are not Enbridge Mainline Receipt & Delivery Points.  14.4  A toll incentive may also be offered for delivery of hydrocarbons to Non Enbridge Mainline Receipt & Delivery Points subject to Section 14.5.   14.5 As required by regulations, tolls to Non Enbridge Mainline Receipt & Delivery Points must be greater than the toll to the nearest upstream Enbridge Mainline Receipt & Delivery Point and must be offered equally to all similarly situated Shippers, as adjusted for distance and commodity types.  15. LAND MATTERS CONSULTATION INITIATIVE 15.1 All Canadian pipeline assets owned by Enbridge that are regulated by the NEB, including the Canadian Mainline, are being addressed in the LMCI.  The LMCI will determine the methodology by which costs for abandonment should be collected by a pipeline.  Enbridge will file all required information under LMCI as per the NEB schedules for the Canadian Mainline. 15.2 The CTS is unrelated to the ultimate decision regarding the responsibility for abandonment costs for the Canadian Mainline.  The CTS is agreed to on a “without prejudice” basis with respect to pipeline abandonment costs for the Canadian Mainline and does not in any way limit either Enbridge or any Shipper’s right to make submissions and fully participate in the LMCI or any other proceeding related to abandonment of a pipeline.  16. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 16.1 “Capital Expenditures” means expenditures on the Enbridge Mainline made by Enbridge which, under Oil Pipeline Uniform Accounting Regulations, require capitalization as fixed assets and which would be capitalized on, or after, July 1, 2011. Capital Expenditures must be prudent, reasonable and to the benefit of the Enbridge Mainline and include, but are not limited to,     (22) maintenance, integrity, equipment additions, improvements and new facilities. Capital Expenditures would include expansion of the Enbridge Mainline such as expanded pipeline capacity, increased storage capacity, or the creation of new or expansion of existing Enbridge Mainline Receipt & Delivery Points. 16.2 Enbridge is responsible for all Capital Expenditures during the Term, meaning the IJT tolls and CLT will not be adjusted for Capital Expenditures unless otherwise agreed to by Enbridge and the Representative Shipper Group.  The 2012 Edmonton Tanks are deemed to be included in the Canadian Mainline as at June 30, 2011, and are therefore included in the IJT tolls and the CLT.    16.3 Enbridge will negotiate with the Representative Shipper Group prior to undertaking any single project on the Enbridge Mainline with expected Capital Expenditures greater than $250 million that expands pipeline capacity, increases storage capacity, or creates or expands Enbridge Mainline Receipt & Delivery Points (“Major Enbridge Mainline Expansion Capital”). With the agreement of Enbridge and the Representative Shipper Group, the IJT tolls and respective CLT may be adjusted to allow Enbridge to recover Major Enbridge Mainline Expansion Capital as allowed for under Section 13.1(c).  An illustrative example of Major Enbridge Mainline Expansion Capital is set forth as Example #1 in Schedule “K”. 16.4 Projects on the Enbridge Mainline which require Capital Expenditures and which are not supported by Enbridge because the incremental revenues associated with such project would not cover the incremental costs, may proceed if there is sufficient financial support from Supporting Shipper(s) pursuant to this Article 16 (a “Shipper Supported Expansion Project”).  An illustrative example of a Shipper Supported Expansion Project is set forth as Example #2 in Schedule “K”. 16.5 By execution of a Backstopping Agreement and confirmation that the proposed project creates no adverse operational issues for Enbridge, as determined by Enbridge acting reasonably, Enbridge     (23) will agree to undertake such Shipper Supported Expansion Projects in accordance with the terms of such Backstopping Agreement.  In the event that Enbridge is unable to secure NEB approval for construction of the Shipper Supported Expansion Project, the Supporting Shipper(s) will be required to reimburse Enbridge for all of such Shipper Supported Expansion Project’s reasonable and prudent development costs as defined in the applicable Backstopping Agreement. 16.6 Subject to Section 16.10, additional revenues derived from tolls, including receipt and delivery terminalling and transmission, collected on the incremental volumes transported on the Enbridge Mainline related to such Shipper Supported Expansion Project, net of any direct incremental costs (“Net Incremental Revenue”) will be credited to the Backstopping Agreement’s revenue requirement. 16.7 The Backstopping Agreement will ensure that the annual revenue requirement associated with the incremental project capital is met either through Net Incremental Revenue from associated incremental throughput or with annual or lump sum payments from the Supporting Shipper(s).  The form and terms of a Backstopping Agreement will be developed on a project by project basis but will utilize the following parameters: a) the term will be no less than 5 years and no more than 10 years and can extend past the end of the Term; b) threshold return on equity of between 11 to 15 percent after tax; and c) capital structure of 45 percent equity.  The return on equity will be negotiated between Enbridge and the Supporting Shipper(s), and the parties acting reasonably will consider such risks as volume, capital, cost, credit, financial or other relevant risks.  An 11 percent return would be appropriate in a circumstance when Enbridge accepted no volume risk, did not share in any operating or capital cost risk, and credit risk was secured by either a letter of credit or a shipper with an Investment Grade credit rating. A 15 percent return would be appropriate in a circumstance when Enbridge accepts substantially more risk with respect to volumes, capital, cost, credit or financial elements of the project.  Similar Shipper Supported Expansion Projects will be evaluated on a similar basis and using similar principles.     (24) 16.8 At the end of the Term, there will be no net rate base impact to the Enbridge Mainline as a result of Shipper Supported Expansion Projects.   16.9 For example, for a Shipper Supported Expansion Project to construct new tanks, the Backstopping Agreement will require the recovery of the capital cost of the tank through accelerated depreciation.  To the extent that such accelerated depreciation exceeds Enbridge’s normal depreciation rates, the excess will be credited against rate base and future depreciation expense will be reduced accordingly.    16.10 Enbridge will consider the Net Incremental Revenue from incremental volumes associated with the Shipper Supported Expansion Projects compared to the incremental capital cost to determine the amount and type of Backstopping Arrangement it will require.  To establish incremental volumes from existing movements, Enbridge will use an appropriate time frame, typically the 12 month period immediately preceding the month in which Enbridge anticipates the in-service date for the new facilities. 16.11 The Backstopping Agreement will incorporate any terms that would allow the Supporting Shipper(s)’s commitment to be reduced by Net Incremental Revenue or capital contribution provided by one or more other Shipper(s). 16.12 Backstopping Agreements are to allow the provision of services, but nothing in this Section 16 is intended to provide any priority service to Supporting Shipper(s).   17. LINE 5 CLAIM 17.1 Following final resolution of the Line 5 Claim, the Canadian Mainline portion of any amounts (net of reasonable litigation costs incurred after June 30, 2011) actually paid to Enbridge, recovered for that period of the Line 5 Claim from January 1, 1995 to March 31, 2011, including any accrued interest, shall be determined, and such portion shall be shared between Enbridge and     (25) the Shippers, with Enbridge to receive 50% and the Shippers to receive 50% (the “Shippers Line 5 Portion”).  Enbridge shall credit the Shippers Line 5 Portion against the next applicable toll filing for both the IJT and the CLT. The Shippers Line 5 Portion will be calculated on the basis of the required sharing under the various incentive tolling settlements that cover the period from January 1, 1995 to March 31, 2011 where the associated costs were shared between Enbridge and the Shippers. 18. COMMODITY SURCHARGE  18.1 Any changes in the commodity surcharge in effect on April 1, 2011, must be mutually agreed to by both Enbridge and the Representative Shipper Group.  The intent of any adjustment to the commodity surcharge methodology considered during the Term is to be revenue neutral.     (26) PART V - RENEGOTIATION AND/OR TERMINATION OF THE CTS 19. MIMIMUM THRESHOLD VOLUMES 19.1 “Minimum Threshold Volume” means a throughput of: (a) 1,250,000 barrels per day to December 31, 2014, then (b) 1,350,000 barrels per day during the remainder of the Term  of Canadian Sourced Hydrocarbons on the Enbridge Mainline ex-Gretna, Manitoba, as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 19.2 and 19.5. 19.2 The Minimum Threshold Volume will be reduced by the amount that the Bakken/Three Forks U.S. production receipts exceed 305,000 barrels per day into the Enbridge Mainline, less those volumes in excess of 305,000 barrels per day that are transported to delivery points other than the Enbridge Mainline Delivery Points into Northern PADD II or Sarnia (for example, incremental transportation of Bakken/Three Forks U.S. production on Mustang/Spearhead or other Non Enbridge Mainline Delivery Points). 19.3 “Nine Month Moving Average” means the sum of the Monthly Moving Average Volumes for the 9 months preceding the date of calculation, divided by 9. 19.4 “Monthly Moving Average Volume” means the volume of Canadian Sourced Hydrocarbons transported on the Enbridge Mainline ex-Gretna, Manitoba in a calendar month, divided by the number of days in such month. 19.5 In the event that Nine Month Moving Average falls below the Minimum Threshold Volume, Enbridge and the Representative Shipper Group will determine if the cause of the shortfall was due to capacity loss on the Enbridge Mainline.  If it is determined that the shortfall was due to capacity loss on the Enbridge Mainline for reasons other than Force Majeure, the Minimum     (27) Threshold Volume will be reduced by the corresponding shortfall amount.  For purposes of determining the applicable capacity loss, Enbridge will use the historical Nine Month Moving Average of volumes from Canadian receipt points through Gretna as well as deliveries ex-Superior.  Schedule “G” sets forth upstream and downstream capacity amounts as at December 31, 2010 as reference points for ex-Gretna capacity. 19.6 Illustrative examples of the calculation of Minimum Threshold Volume are set forth in Schedule “L”. 20. MATERIAL CHANGE IN BUSINESS CIRCUMSTANCES 20.1 “Material Change in Business Circumstances” means: (i) Regulatory Change(s) or Enbridge Specific Regulatory Change(s) which results in cumulative  expenditures in a calendar year for operating costs on the Enbridge Mainline, calculated to include an amount for depreciation expense (not including depreciation expense resulting from Integrity Capital ) and subtract applicable capital cost allowance, increasing by more than $10,000,000 over what such annual operating costs would have been (based on Enbridge’s applicable operating standards immediately prior to the Regulatory Change(s) or Enbridge Specific Regulatory Change(s)) absent the Regulatory Change(s) or Enbridge Specific Regulatory Change(s); or  (ii) Regulatory Change(s) which results in cumulative expenditures (commencing on the date of the first such Regulatory Change) for Integrity Capital on the Enbridge Mainline increasing by more than $100,000,000 over what such costs would have been absent the Regulatory Changes, provided however that such Regulatory Changes(s) are broadly applicable to the Enbridge Mainline and all similar liquids pipelines.       (28) 20.2 The IJT and CLT include (and therefore Enbridge is responsible for) the first $10,000,000 in operating expenses in each calendar year on the Enbridge Mainline associated with any Regulatory Changes or Enbridge Specific Regulatory Changes, as applicable, and the first $100,000,000 of Integrity Capital during the Term on the Enbridge Mainline associated with any Regulatory Changes.  In calculating that amounts attributable to such operating expenses or Integrity Capital, Enbridge shall deduct from such calculation any amount that Enbridge would have otherwise spent absent such Regulatory Change or Enbridge Specific Regulatory Change, as applicable. 21. EVENTS TRIGGERING A RENEGOTIATION PERIOD 21.1 If the Keystone XL pipeline project does not receive the required U.S. presidential permit by January 1, 2013, then the Representative Shipper Group may, on or before February 1, 2013, provide to Enbridge a Renegotiation Notice. 21.2 If the Material Change in Business Circumstances referred to in Section 20.1(ii) occurs, Enbridge will, as soon as reasonably practicable following such occurrence, provide notice to the Representative Shipper Group.  Following receipt of such notice, the Representative Shipper Group and Enbridge shall meet to determine whether they can agree to a Contingent Toll Adjustment under Article 13.  In the event a Contingent Toll Adjustment is not agreed to within 90 days, then the Representative Shipper Group may provide to Enbridge a Renegotiation Notice. 21.3 If the Nine-Month Moving Average is less than the Minimum Threshold Volume, then Enbridge may, as soon as is reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event, provide to the Representative Shipper Group a Renegotiation Notice. 21.4 Upon receipt by either Enbridge or the Representative Shipper Group of a Renegotiation Notice, Enbridge and the Representative Shipper Group (the “Renegotiating Team”) shall meet and use     (29) reasonable efforts to agree on how the CTS can be amended to accommodate the events referred to in Section 21.1, 21.2, or 21.3 above. 21.5 If, within 90 days following receipt of the Renegotiation Notice, the Renegotiating Team is unable to agree on how the CTS can be amended, then the Renegotiating Team may agree to extend the renegotiation period.  If the Renegotiating Team does not agree to extend the renegotiation period, then the CTS terminates and Enbridge will file a new toll application for the Canadian Mainline.   21.6 The IJT and the CLT will apply during the renegotiation period and will become the interim toll after the renegotiation period until a new toll filing is approved by the NEB.      (30) PART VI – OTHER CTS MATTERS 22. REPRESENTATIVE SHIPPER GROUP 22.1  Enbridge will work with its Shippers, CAPP and Western Canadian Producers to develop, by July 3, 2012, and thereafter file with the NEB, a transparent process, in compliance with current regulatory requirements, to review and administer issues related to the CTS and the formation of the Representative Shipper Group.  This process is intended to be used toward reaching agreement on the resolution of issues related to the CTS during the Term and to provide a counter-party to negotiate any required changes to the CTS resulting from unanticipated events relating to the CTS, with a view to reducing adversarial aspects of NEB and FERC hearings, as well as reducing hearing time and associated costs.   22.2  The Representative Shipper Group will have representation from CAPP, CAPP members and other Shippers or interested parties as applicable (the “Representative Shipper Group”).    23. SERVICE LEVELS 23.1 The Enbridge Service Levels, as adjusted from time to time, will continue to apply. 24. GENERAL TANKAGE PRINCIPLES 24.1 During the Term, Enbridge will provide sufficient receipt and breakout tankage to manage the receipt and transportation of crude petroleum in accordance with the Enbridge Service Levels under normal operating conditions.   24.2 Any incremental delivery tankage requirements requested by a Shipper are the responsibility of that Shipper.      (31) 25. END OF TERM ISSUES 25.1 Enbridge and the Representative Shipper Group will, no later than July 1, 2019, establish a group for the purposes of negotiating a new settlement following expiry of the CTS (the “2021 Negotiating Team”).  The 2021 Negotiation Team will begin to negotiate a new settlement that is applicable after the expiry of the CTS.  The 2021 Negotiating Team will also review and endorse discretionary capital projects proposed by Enbridge under the CTS in the last two years of the CTS, prior to Enbridge undertaking any such discretionary capital projects.  Discretionary capital projects will include any projects less than $250 million excluding maintenance capital and Integrity Capital projects. If negotiations for a new settlement fail, the CTS will terminate on June 30, 2021 and Enbridge will, exercising reasonable diligence, file a new application for tolls with the NEB for the Canadian Mainline.   The IJT and CLT tolls will become the interim tolls until the new toll application is approved by the NEB.   25.2 At the end of the Term, Enbridge will not carry forward amounts based on toll or volume variances in a new settlement agreement or extended CTS unless otherwise agreed to by Enbridge and the 2021 Negotiation Team. 25.3 Unless otherwise mutually agreed to by Enbridge and the 2021 Negotiating Team, the cumulative amount spent by Enbridge on maintenance and integrity in the last two years of the CTS must be equal to or greater than an amount equal to the average annual amount spent by Enbridge on maintenance and integrity, excluding any amounts spent as a result of Regulatory Changes or Enbridge Specific Regulatory Changes, in the first eight years of the CTS multiplied by 2. 25.4 The 2010 Depreciation Technical Update Study incorporates a truncation date of 2039 which was approved by the NEB on May 8, 2010.  At the end of the Term, the depreciation rates to be applied to rates subject to the NEB’s jurisdiction, exclusive of the rates covered by Section 25.5     (32) below, will be based on the depreciation truncation date implicit in the 2010 Depreciation Technical Update Study subject to Section 25.5. 25.5 Applicable depreciation rates for the assets comprising the Enbridge Mainline are set forth in Schedules “H” and “I”.       (33) PART VII – GENERAL PROVISIONS 26. REPORTING AND FILING REQUIREMENTS 26.1 Each February during the Term, Enbridge will provide the Representative Shipper Group with a summary of capital additions for the prior year and forecast capital additions for the current year to the Enbridge Mainline rate base in total and will detail individual items that exceed $50 million, and the aggregate amount of capital under Shipper Supported Expansion Project(s) in accordance with the Capital Reporting Template. Enbridge will continue to meet with Shippers to annually review the Enbridge Mainline integrity plan, metrics and overall operating plan.   26.2 In addition, each February of 2019, 2020 and 2021, Enbridge will provide a summary of the forecast capital additions to the Enbridge Mainline rate base for all pending projects or future projects anticipated to be initiated before the end of the Term that exceed $50 million that could result in an addition to the Enbridge Mainline rate base either before or after the end of the Term. 26.3 Enbridge shall file with the applicable regulator and make available to interested parties copies of the CTS tolls and tariffs for each year.  26.4 Subject to NEB approval, the intention of the CTS is that Enbridge will be exempt from the requirement for Enbridge to file financial forecasts and Financial Surveillance Reports, consistent with the relief granted pursuant to Board Order TO-3-2000, as amended.  27. AUDIT 27.1 Enbridge shall file an external auditors’ report for the Enbridge consolidated financial statements with the NEB annually for each fiscal year ending December 31 by March 31 of the following year.  The same such auditor’s report will be provided to all other interested parties on request. 27.2 The Enbridge consolidated financial statements for each fiscal year ending December 31st will be audited by an independent auditor and reported in a manner consistent with Canadian Auditing     (34) Standards.  The purpose of this audit is to confirm that the financial results as reflected on are in accordance with the provisions of the CTS, including the completeness and accuracy of the annual tolls and any relevant surcharges. 27.3 Upon 60 days notice to Enbridge by the Representative Shipper Group, and subject to Enbridge’s confidentiality obligations to third parties, the Representative Shipper Group shall be able to, on two occasions, elect to engage an independent accountant or other auditor to conduct its own audit of the Enbridge financial results and of all data and information related to and necessary to establish compliance with the CTS, provided that no such audit shall occur any later than 24 months from the end of the Term.  The independent accountant or other auditor will enter into a confidentiality agreement with Enbridge to ensure non-disclosure of confidential or commercial information.  Enbridge agrees to undertake all reasonable commercial efforts to assist in the completion of the audit on a timely basis, during normal business hours.  Shippers shall bear all third party costs associated with such audits. 28. ACCOUNTING 28.1 Enbridge will continue to use flow through tax accounting as directed by the NEB under order Order TO-1-92. 29. AFFILIATES 29.1 Enbridge agrees to abide by the Enbridge Canadian Affiliate Relationship Code which was developed in collaboration with CAPP, as may be amended from time to time, the current version of which is posted on Enbridge’s website at: http://www.enbridge.com/InvestorRelations/CorporateGovernance/~/media/Site%20Documents/Investor%20Relations/Corporate%20Governance/Key%20Documents/carc-epi-2010.ashx .     (35) 30. DISPUTE RESOLUTION 30.1 To facilitate the resolution of any disputes regarding the CTS in an efficient and expedited manner, disputes arising under this CTS (“Dispute”) shall be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution mechanism set forth in this Article 30.  For clarity, this Article 30 is not intended to permit a party to renegotiate terms that have been agreed to in the CTS or to resolve deadlocks between the parties over an action where the approval of any parties is required under this CTS to such action. 30.2 In the event of a Dispute, either of Enbridge or a Shipper(s) (the Shipper or group of Shippers initiating the Dispute the “Disputing Shipper Group”) that wishes to initiate dispute resolution shall give written notice (the “Dispute Notice”) to any party of a Dispute and outline in reasonable detail the relevant information concerning the Dispute.  The Disputing Shipper Group may self-form and is not dependent on formation pursuant to Section 22.1.  Within fourteen (14) days following receipt of the Dispute Notice, Enbridge and the Disputing Shipper Group will each appoint representatives to meet to discuss and attempt to resolve the Dispute.  Such representatives shall be individuals that are technically qualified to appreciate and assess the Dispute and have authority to negotiate the Dispute.  If the Dispute is not settled within ninety (90) days of receipt of the Dispute Notice, the negotiation will be deemed to have failed. 30.3 If the Dispute is not resolved pursuant to the process above, the Dispute may be referred to the NEB or other applicable regulator by either Enbridge or the Disputing Shipper Group, to be resolved on an expedited basis.  30.4 Notwithstanding the above, any parties retain all rights for dispute resolution with the applicable regulator.      (36) PART VIII – LINE 9 MATTERS 31. LINE 9  31.1 Enbridge owns and operates Line 9, a common carrier pipeline system regulated under the NEB Act.  The assets included in Line 9 are outlined in Schedule “C”. 31.2 Line 9 tolls are currently set on a standalone basis and will continue to be set on a standalone basis under the CTS regardless of whether Line 9 is used for East to West or West to East service or is used for partial East to West and partial West to East service.  Standalone tolling under the CTS continues to treat Line 9 assets as separate and distinct assets from the Enbridge Mainline assets.  Standalone tolling under the CTS continues to base Line 9 tolls on the separate and distinct Line 9 rate base.   31.3 Line 9 tolls are currently published under an NEB approved Line 9 Tariff. Subject to applicable law and approval by the NEB, tolls for transportation of hydrocarbons on Line 9 will continue to be published under a separate Line 9 tariff. In the event that Enbridge applies to reverse service on Line 9 and such reversal is approved by the NEB, such that Line 9 or a portion of Line 9 is operated in a fashion that allows volumes to flow from the Canadian Mainline into Line 9 and supports flow of hydrocarbons from West to East in Line 9, Enbridge may file, at its discretion, a negotiated International Joint Tariff for delivery on Line 9 at that time. 31.4 In the event that Enbridge files an application to reverse service on Line 9 or a portion of Line 9 and such reversal is approved by the NEB, the stand alone toll for the transportation of hydrocarbons on Line 9 in a West to East service (“Line 9 Local Tolls”) shall be adjusted annually, up or down, at a rate of 75% of the GDPP Index. 31.5 The CTS is unrelated to any decision regarding the possible reversal of Line 9.   The CTS does not limit in any way a party’s rights to make submissions and fully participate in any Line 9     (37) reversal facilities application and is entirely without prejudice to the position of any party in such an application.    31.6 Subject to applicable law, tolls under a negotiated international joint tariff for the transportation of hydrocarbons from the Canadian Mainline to delivery points on Line 9 will be published when available.  31.7 Enbridge may offer incentives in order to attract incremental volumes onto Line 9, provided such toll incentives on Line 9 are offered equally to all shippers on Line 9, as adjusted for distance and commodity types. 31.8 The CTS is unrelated to any decision regarding the responsibility for the costs of abandoning Line 9. The CTS is entirely without prejudice to the position of any party on the question of responsibility for the cost of abandonment of Line 9. 31.9 All Canadian pipeline assets owned by Enbridge that are regulated by the NEB, including Line 9, are being addressed in the LMCI process. The LMCI process will determine the methodology by which costs for abandonment should be collected by a pipeline.  Enbridge will file all required information under LMCI as per the NEB schedules for Line 9.  Through the LMCI process, whatever abandonment costs the NEB approves for pre-collection from shippers on Line 9 will form part of the standalone costs of Line 9.  Enbridge will not apply for abandonment of Line 9 during the Term unless ordered to do so by the NEB. 31.10 For greater certainty, all parties may fully participate in the LMCI process or any other proceeding related to abandonment and the CTS does not limit in any way a party’s right to make submissions regarding Line 9 abandonment or abandonment costs. The CTS is unrelated to the ultimate decision regarding the responsibility for abandonment costs for Line 9.      (38) 31.11 “Line 9 Capital Expenditures” means expenditures on the Line 9 made by Enbridge which, under Oil Pipeline Uniform Accounting Regulations, require capitalization as fixed assets. Line 9 Capital Expenditures must be prudent, reasonable and to the benefit of Line 9 and include, but are not limited to, maintenance, integrity, equipment additions, improvements and new facilities. Line 9 Capital Expenditures would include expansion of Line 9 such as expanded pipeline capacity, increased storage capacity, or the creation or expansion of new Line 9 receipt and delivery points. 31.12 Enbridge is responsible for all Line 9 Capital Expenditures on Line 9 during the Term. 31.13 Enbridge will negotiate with shippers on Line 9 prior to any single project on Line 9 with expected Line 9 Capital Expenditures greater than $25 million that expands pipeline capacity, increases storage capacity, or creates or expands new Line 9 receipt and delivery points.  31.14 Projects on Line 9 which require Line 9 Capital Expenditures and which are not supported by Enbridge because the incremental revenues associated with such project would not cover the incremental costs, may proceed if there is sufficient financial support from a shipper(s) on Line 9 (a “Line 9 Shipper Supported Expansion Project”).  31.15 By execution of an agreement whereby a shipper on Line 9 agrees to backstop Enbridge’s revenue requirement for Line 9 Shipper Supported Expansion Projects (a “Line 9 Backstopping Agreement”) and confirmation that the proposed project creates no adverse operational issues for Enbridge, as determined by Enbridge acting reasonably, Enbridge will agree to undertake such Line 9 Shipper Supported Expansion Projects in accordance with the terms of such Line 9 Backstopping Agreement.  In the event that Enbridge is unable to secure NEB approval for construction of the project, the shipper on Line 9 who supports a Line 9 Shipper Supported Expansion Project by executing a Line 9 Backstopping Agreement (the “Line 9 Supporting     (39) Shipper(s)”) will be required to reimburse Enbridge for all of the project’s reasonable and prudent development costs as defined in the applicable Line 9 Backstopping Agreement. 31.16 Subject to Section 31.20, additional revenues derived from tolls, including receipt and delivery terminalling and transmission, collected on the incremental volumes transported on the Enbridge Mainline and Line 9 related to such Line 9 Shipper Supported Expansion Project, net of any direct incremental costs (“Net Line 9 Incremental Revenue”) will be credited to the Line 9 Backstopping Agreement’s revenue requirement.  31.17 The Line 9 Backstopping Agreement will ensure that the annual revenue requirement associated with the incremental project capital is met either through Net Line 9 Incremental Revenue from associated incremental throughput or lump sum payments from the Line 9 Supporting Shipper(s).  The form and terms of a Line 9 Backstopping Agreement will be developed on a project by project basis but will utilize the following parameters: a) the term will be no less than 5 years and no more than 10 years and can extend past the end of the Term; b) threshold return on equity of between 11 to 15 percent after tax; and c) capital structure of 45 percent equity.  The return on equity will be negotiated between, Enbridge and the Line 9 Supporting Shipper(S), and the parties acting reasonably, will consider such risks as volume, capital, cost, credit, financial or other relevant risks.  An 11 percent return would be appropriate in a circumstance when Enbridge accepted no volume risk, did not share in any operating or capital cost risk, and credit risk was secured by either a letter of credit or a shipper with an Investment Grade credit rating. A 15 percent return would be appropriate in a circumstance when Enbridge accepts substantially more risk with respect to volumes, capital, cost, credit or financial elements of the project. Similar Line 9 Shipper Supported Expansion Projects will be evaluated on a similar basis and using similar principles. 31.18 At the end of the Term, there will be no net rate base impact to Line 9 as a result of Line 9 Shipper Supported Expansion Projects.      (40) 31.19 For example, for a Line 9 Shipper Supported Expansion Project to construct new tanks, the Line 9 Backstopping Agreement will require the recovery of the capital cost of the tank through accelerated depreciation.  To the extent that such accelerated depreciation exceeds Enbridge’s normal depreciation rates for Line 9, the excess will be credited against the Line 9 rate base and future depreciation expense will be reduced accordingly.   31.20 Enbridge will consider the Net Line 9 Incremental Revenue from incremental volumes associated with Line 9 Shipper Supported Expansion Projects compared to the incremental capital cost to determine the amount and type of Line 9 Backstopping Arrangement it will require.  To establish incremental volumes from existing movements, Enbridge will use an appropriate time frame, typically the 12 month period immediately preceding the month in which Enbridge anticipates the in-service date for the new facilities. 31.21 The Line 9 Backstopping Agreement will incorporate any terms that would allow the Line 9 Supporting Shipper’s commitment to be reduced by Net Line 9 Incremental Revenue or capital contribution provided by one or more other shipper(s) on Line 9. 31.22 Line 9 Backstopping Agreements are to allow the provision of services, but nothing in this Article 31 is intended to provide any priority service to Line 9 Supporting Shippers. 31.23 Each February during the Term, Enbridge will provide shippers on Line 9 with a summary of capital additions for the prior year and forecast capital additions for the current year to the Line 9 rate base in total and will detail individual items that exceed $5 million, and the aggregate amount of capital under a Shipper Supported Expansion Project in accordance with the Line 9 Capital Reporting Template included in Schedule “O”. Enbridge will continue to meet with shippers on Line 9 to annually review the Line 9 integrity plan, metrics and overall operating plan. 31.24 In addition, each February of 2019, 2020 and 2021, Enbridge will provide a summary of the forecast capital additions to the Line 9 rate base for all pending projects or future projects     (41) anticipated to be initiated before the end of the Term that exceed $5 million that could result in an addition to the Line 9 rate base before the end of the Term. 31.25 Enbridge shall file with the NEB and make available to interested parties copies of the Line 9 tolls and tariffs for each year.

Project A agreement dated November 30, 2009 has a 30 year term commencing January 1, 2010 and ending December 31, 2040. 2. The Agreement stated straight line depreciation over 30 years at a depreciation rate of 3 1/3rd % annually. 3. Rate base is equal to the Net Book Value of Project A capital assets. 4. The capital cost of Project A at January 1, 2010 is $50,000,000. 5. All power and operating costs are flow through except as otherwise agreed. 6. The agreed to fixed operating costs charges to Project A were agreed to be $3,000,000 for the calendar year ending December 31, 2010 and are allowed to escalate at 50% of the GDPP Index annually. 7. The CTS supersedes the Project A agreement from July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2021. 8. From January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2021 $1 million of actual capital costs are spent on the Project A assets annually for maintenance and integrity – assume additions occur evenly throughout each year. 9. GDPP Index is 3% annually Based on the above assumptions, at the end of the CTS on July 1, 2021, the following Project A terms would be relevant: 1) The approximate rate base would be $40,150,538 based on the following schedule: PERIOD Date Rate Base at Period End Additions for Period Ending Depreciation for Period Ending 0 January 1, 2010 $50,000,000 N/A N/A 1 December 31, 2010 49,318,350 $1,000,000 1,681,650 2 June 30, 2011 48,965,038 $500,000 853,313 3 June 30, 2012 48,233,438 $1,000,000 1,731,600 4 June 30, 2013 47,468,538 $1,000,000 1,764,900 5 June 30, 2014 46,670,338 $1,000,000 1,798,200 6 June 30, 2015 45,838,838 $1,000,000 1,831,500 7 June 30, 2016 44,974,038 $1,000,000 1,864,800 8 June 30, 2017 44,075,938 $1,000,000 1,898,100 9 June 30, 2018 43,144538 $1,000,000 1,931,400 10 June 30, 2019 42,179,838 $1,000,000 1,964,700 11 June 30, 2020 41,181,838 $1,000,000 1,998,800 12 June 30, 2021 40,150,538 $1,000,000 2,031,300 13 December 31, 2021 39,642,400 $500,000 1,028,138    J-2  2) The fixed operating cost charges that will be allocated to Project A for the period from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 would be $1,766,923.40 ($3,533,846.80X 50%) based on the following schedule: YEAR Date Fixed Operating Costs Allowed 50% of GDPP Index 0 December 31, 2010 $3,000,000  1 December 31, 2011 $3,045,000 1.5% 2 December 31, 2012 $3,090,675 1.5% 3 December 31, 2013 $3,137,035.10 1.5% 4 December 31, 2014 $3,184,090.70 1.5% 5 December 31, 2015 $3,231,852 1.5% 6 December 31, 2016 $3,280,329.80 1.5% 7 December 31, 2017 $3,329,534.80 1.5% 8 December 31, 2018 $3,379,477.80 1.5% 9 December 31, 2019 $3,430,169.90 1.5% 10 December 31, 2020 $3,481,622.50 1.5% 11 December 31, 2021 $3,533,846.80 1.5%     K-1 SCHEDULE “K” – ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES UNDER SECTION 16.3 & 16.4  Example #1 – Section 16.3 Assumptions: 1. The Representative Shipper Group has requested that Enbridge expand capacity on the Enbridge Mainline by 150,000 barrels per day by December 31, 2017. 2. Enbridge has completed a capital cost estimate that the project will cost approximately $500,000,000 – ½ in Canada and ½ in the U.S. Per Section 16.3, the anticipated capital cost of the project will exceed $250,000,000.  As a result, Enbridge would be required to work with the Representative Shipper Group to negotiate any adjustment to the applicable IJT and CLT. Conclusion: Enbridge would negotiate with the Representative Shipper Group to determine if the IJT and CLT need to be adjusted. Example #2 – Section 16.4 Assumptions: 1. One shipper, Shipper Z, has requested that Enbridge increase receipt tankage at the Edmonton terminal on the Canadian Mainline to accommodate incremental volumes of 15,000 barrels per day by June 30, 2015 from a new production area.   2. Enbridge has reviewed the service request details and is not confident that the 15,000 barrels per day of anticipated increased volumes will be required by June 30, 2015 and is uncertain, if such volumes are received on the Enbridge Mainline at the Edmonton Terminal, when the volumes would exit the Enbridge Mainline. As such, the economic benefit to Enbridge and the overall benefit of adding additional tanks into the Canadian Mainline rate base cannot be confirmed. 3. Shipper Z and Enbridge are prepared to enter into a Backstopping Agreement to support the tankage service request on the following terms, consistent with Section 16: a.  10 year term beginning July 1, 2015 to the earlier of June 30, 2025 or such time as all financial commitments of Shipper Z under the Backstopping Agreement have been fulfilled. b.  Based on a capital structure of 45% equity c. Cost of debt of 6% d. Enbridge will accept a return of 13% return on equity based on the overall risks assumed e. Effectively amortize the cost of the capital over the 10 year term of the agreement; Revenue in Excess of the Revenue Requirement will be applied to the capital balance at the end of each year such excess is generated. f. Shipper Z will backstop based on 15,000 barrels per day – assumes that barrels enter the Enbridge Mainline in Edmonton and are transported to Chicago area with an initial toll of $4.50 per barrel increasing @ 2.25% per year, less incremental operating costs.      K-2 g. Incremental operating cost (power) is initially $1.00 per barrel escalating at 2.25% per year. h. To accommodate the incremental volumes, Enbridge constructed a new tank at the Edmonton Terminal for a cost $80,000,000 with an in-service date of July 1, 2015    i. Annual incremental operating costs were $500,000 in the first year increasing at 3% per year. j. The Tankage expenditures result in an 8% CCA class and the tax rate is 25% for all year. k. Upon fulfillment of all commitments by Shipper Z under the Backstopping Agreement, the net present value of the future CCA will be paid as a credit to Shipper Z. Conclusion:  Based on the above assumptions and the delivery profile outlined below, the following table outlines the annual financial outcome: Year Ended Average Daily Barrels Revenue Requirement (including incremental asset operating costs) Revenue Generated (less incremental transportation costs) Excess Revenue (net of tax) / (Shortfall  Payment) (grossed up for tax) Cumulative Capital Recovered (including net Excess Revenue) June 30, 2016 11,000 18,533 14,053 (5,972) 8,000 June 30, 2017 12,000 16,680 15,675 (1,339) 16,000 June 30, 2018 12,000 15,971 16,028 42 24,042 June 30, 2019 13,000 15,245 17,754 1,882 33,924 June 30, 2020 12,500 14,303 17,455 2,364 44,288 June 30, 2021 13,000 13,297 18,562 3,948 56,237 June 30, 2022 14,000 12,106 20,439 6,250 70,487 June 30, 2023 15,000 6,778 14,395 11,711 80,000 July 31, 2023 N/A (5,000)* N/A N/A N/A June 30, 2024 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A June 30, 2025 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A  *- Capital payout achieved at end of preceding contract year.

L-1 SCHEDULE “L” – ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES OF CALCULATION OF MINIMUM THRESHOLD VOLUMES Minimum Threshold Volumes Example #1 Assumptions: 1. Enbridge Mainline throughput ex-Gretna has been at 1,275,000 barrels per day on average for the 9 month period ending July 31, 2016. 2. The Enbridge Mainline has received 325,000 barrels per day of the Bakken/ Three Forks U.S. production on average for the same 9 month period ending July 31, 2016. 3. All the Bakken/ Three Forks U.S. production received on the Enbridge Mainline for the nine month period ending July 31, 2016 were delivered into Northern PADD II or Sarnia. 4. There are no other adjustments to the Minimum Threshold Volume. Based on the above assumptions, the applicable Minimum Threshold Volume would be:  1,350,000 barrels per day (per Section 19.1 – after December 31, 2014)  Less 20,000 barrels per day (per Section 19.2 – reduced by the amount that Bakken Three Forks US receipts exceed 305,000 barrels per day) = Minimum Threshold Volumes of 1,330,000 barrels per day Conclusion:  Enbridge would be in a position to provide a Renegotiation Notice.  Minimum Threshold Volumes Example #2 Assumptions: 1. Enbridge Mainline throughput ex-Gretna has been at 1,200,000 barrels per day on average for the 9 month period ending December 31, 2012. 2. The Enbridge Mainline has received 385,000 barrels per day of the Bakken/ Three Forks U.S. production on average for the same 9 month period ending December 31, 2012. 3. 20,000 barrels per day of the Bakken/ Three Forks U.S. production received on the Enbridge Mainline for the nine month period ending December 31, 2012 were delivered into Mustang. 4. 365,000 barrels per day of the Bakken/ Three Forks U.S. production received on the Enbridge Mainline for the nine month period ending December 31, 2012 were delivered into Northern PADD II or Sarnia.  5. There are no other adjustments to the Minimum Threshold Volume. Based on the above assumptions, the applicable Minimum Threshold Volume would be:  1,250,000 barrels per day (per Section 19.1 – before December 31, 2014)  Less 60,000 barrels per day (per Section 19.2 – reduced by the amount that Bakken Three Forks U.S. receipts exceed 305,000 barrels per day delivered into PADD II or Sarnia   L-2 = Minimum Threshold Volumes of 1,190,000 barrels per day Conclusion:  Enbridge would NOT be in a position to provide a Renegotiation Notice. Minimum Threshold Volumes Example #3 Assumptions: 1. On May 31, 2013 flooding of the Red River in Manitoba, significantly impacted the Canadian Mainline, in a manner that was beyond reasonable design or operational considerations and reduced throughput ex-Gretna to 1,000,000 barrels per day. Enbridge has undertaken its best efforts, which are considered reasonable by industry standards, between May 31, 2013 and February 28, 2014 to repair the damage and remove all pressure restrictions.   2. Enbridge Mainline throughput ex-Gretna was 1,500,000 barrels per day on average for the 9 month period ending May 30, 2013. 3.

INTRODUCTION  This document provides information respecting Enbridge’s operation and service levels.     The Service Levels and system operation are based on the system configuration in place for the second quarter of 2011.  The actual service of the pipeline on a day-to-day basis will depend on numerous variables.  Enbridge will use reasonable efforts to operate the pipeline system in accordance with current Service Levels.  As changes occur to the pipeline system configuration and operation, or customer requirements, Service Level revisions will be undertaken to reflect such changes.  Enbridge is obligated to provide transportation service pursuant to the terms and conditions specified by the tariff Rules and Regulations, on file with the National Energy Board (NEB).  Service Levels provided in this document are not intended to amend the tariff Rules and Regulations.  The Service Levels described encompass both the Enbridge Canadian and United States (U.S.) Mainline1 transportation systems.  The service references for Lakehead2 are not intended to amend the service rules and regulations outlined in Lakehead’s tariff, on file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).  The Enbridge Service Levels described in this document are broken into three sections: Operations, Procedures and Reporting, and Communications.  The Operations section describes movement associated with the current Mainline System operation.  For the commodities shipped on the system this section describes normal line routings, transit times, tankage considerations and batch management.  The Procedures and Reporting section outlines scheduling events, supply control activities and other general movement information.  The Communication section provides a statement on the general principles around communication to Enbridge’s customer base.                                                             1 Enbridge Pipelines Inc., Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P., and Enbridge Pipelines (Toledo) Inc. 2 Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P.     Enbridge Service Levels   Page 3     2. OPERATIONS   A. General  Enbridge provides transportation service using a batched system to retain commodity integrity and shipper ownership for a wide variety of Crude Petroleum, Refined Products and Natural Gas Liquids (NGL).  The Enbridge system is a supply driven system, with shippers (producers, marketers and refiners) nominating supplies onto the system on a monthly basis.  These supplies are scheduled and routed through the system to identified delivery locations.  Nominations for local transfers through an Enbridge terminal are routed as operating conditions allow. During the month supplies are received from feeder pipelines/transfer facilities into the various Enbridge receipt facilities where the supplies are aggregated for shipment and/or directly injected into the Mainline System.  Subject to the operating conditions of the pipeline system, shippers may request changes to injection and delivery location, volume and commodity type on receipt and delivery and ownership, which may result in operational adjustments.  B. Ratability  Enbridge’s objective is to operate its system so that nominations are pumped and delivered on a ratable and predictable basis. Delivery ratability and predictability are primarily dependent upon ratable supply into Enbridge.  Supply ratability can affect Enbridge’s ability to meet the Service Levels described below.  C. Commodity Receipt Summary (Tables 1A and 1B)  The Enbridge system transports a wide variety of commodities, including both Canadian and U.S. receipts.  Tables 1A and 1B depict the current approved receipt commodities with their acronyms, receipt locations, and feeder pipeline/transfer facilities on both the Enbridge and Lakehead transportation systems.  New commodities not in the table must be applied for through the applicable service request procedure.  Commodities not shipped for a period of time or which revert to a commingled stream are subject to removal from the table, and will be required to be re-applied for to be re-instated.  D. Commodity Routing Summary by Pipeline Segment (Table 2)  Enbridge provides batch transportation service where commodities are segregated according to quality specifications and standards to minimize interfacial contamination between batches and track batch ownership.  Individual pipeline segments comprising the Enbridge Mainline System are used to transport specific commodities.  Allocation of commodities to these pipelines is dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to petroleum quality, supply, tankage constraints, connectivity, receipt and delivery patterns, ratability, apportionment and power costs.  Enbridge Service Levels   Page 4      Enbridge reserves the right to revise commodity allocations to optimize pipeline operations in a fair and equitable manner.  The summary provided in Table 2 provides the base Service Level routings and permissible routing of commodities.  A schematic system diagram is attached to this table (as Figure 1) and describes the general commodity slate for each pipeline segment.  E. General Pipeline Operations  The following outlines pipeline operations for each pipeline segment.  Upstream of Superior Pipelines  Line 1 (Edmonton to Superior)  Line 1 originates at Edmonton and extends to Superior, Wisconsin transporting natural gas liquids (NGL), refined products, synthetics and required synthetic buffers.  There are six refined products cycles (three gasoline and three distillate cycles) and six NGL cycles per month. All NGL and refined product volumes are pumped as a direct receipt from feeder pipeline or connected refineries.   Refined products are injected at Edmonton and Regina and are delivered at Milden Take-off, Regina and Gretna.  NGL is injected at Edmonton, Kerrobert and Cromer and is transported to breakout facilities at Superior Terminal.  All crude volumes access breakout tankage at Superior before being re-pumped over Lines 5, 6, 14 or 61, or as tank transfer deliveries to Murphy.  NGL advances through the NGL spheres to be re-pumped over Line 5 or as sphere transfer deliveries to BP-NGL.   Line 2 (Edmonton to Superior)  The pipeline segment from Edmonton to Cromer is referred to as Line 2A and the pipeline segment from Cromer to Superior is referred to as Line 2B.  All Line 2A volumes breakout into Cromer tankage before being re-pumped on Line 2B.  Line 2A (Edmonton to Cromer)  Line 2A originates at Edmonton and pumps condensate, light synthetic, sweet, light sour and high sour batches.  Batches are scheduled to pump with compatible crude types adjacent to one another, if available.  At Hardisty, deliveries of condensate, light synthetic, sweet, light sour and high sour crude batches may be scheduled to Express Pipeline, Hardisty Caverns, L.P., Gibsons, Husky, Flint Hills Resources, Enbridge Hardisty Contract Terminal, or Enbridge Mainline tankage. During deliveries, if possible, injections of light synthetic are scheduled simultaneously to optimize Line 2 operations.  Enbridge Service Levels   Page 5      At Kerrobert, deliveries of condensate to Plains occur simultaneously, if possible, with sweet injections.  At Regina, deliveries of condensate to Plains and light synthetic crudes to Consumers Co-op or Wascana Pipeline occur simultaneously, if possible, with light synthetic or high sour injections.  At Cromer, all incoming Line 2A volumes access breakout tankage.  Line 2B (Cromer to Superior)  At Cromer all Line 2A volumes along with sweet and light sour receipts entering the system at Cromer are rescheduled and reinjected on a daily cycle including condensate, light synthetic, sweet, light sour and high sour receipts.    At Clearbrook, mostly light synthetic along with some sweet and high sour batches are delivered to Minnesota Pipeline. During these Line 2 deliveries ""windows"" U.S. sweet volumes are injected.  There is also the ability to inject light sour and medium crude coming from Line 65 via Clearbrook tankage if necessary.   At Superior, the volumes access breakout tankage and are scheduled to re-pump over Lines 5, 6, 14, or 61, or as tank transfer deliveries to Murphy.    Line 3 (Edmonton to Superior)  Line 3 originates at Edmonton and pumps condensate, light synthetic, sweet, light sour and high sour batches.  Batches are scheduled to pump with compatible crude types adjacent to one another, if available.  At Hardisty, available deliveries of condensate, light synthetic, sweet, light sour and high sour batches may be scheduled to Express Pipeline, Gibsons, Husky and Flint Hills Resources.  During these Line 3 deliveries “windows”, if possible, injections of high sour from Gibsons or light synthetic batches from Enbridge Mainline Tankage are scheduled to optimize Line 3 operations.   At Clearbrook, in the event that deliveries are scheduled off of Line 3, volumes coming from Line 65 via Clearbrook tankage may be injected.  If required, U.S. sweet and/or volumes coming from Line 2B via Clearbrook tankage may also be injected. Line 3 cannot deliver to Clearbrook tankage.  At Superior, the volumes access breakout tankage and are scheduled to re-pump over Lines 5, 6, 14, or 61, or as tank transfer deliveries to Murphy.  Line 4 (Edmonton to Superior)  Line 4 originates at Edmonton and pumps heavy volumes received at Edmonton, Hardisty, Kerrobert and Regina.  Some of the volumes originating at Hardisty and Kerrobert are scheduled for injection on a nominal 2-day cycle.   Enbridge Service Levels   Page 6      At Edmonton available volumes of heavy are scheduled and pumped in each cycle.  Sarnia Special volumes are pumped on an as-requested basis subject to the availability of receipt tankage.  At Hardisty deliveries of heavy crude batches to Express Pipeline, Hardisty Caverns, L.P., Flint Hills Resources, Enbridge Hardisty Contract Terminal, and Gibsons are available off Line 4.  Hardisty Line 4 injections from Gibsons, Husky, Flint Hills Resources, Hardisty Caverns, L.P., Enbridge Hardisty Contract Terminal, and Enbridge mainline tankage commence with Hardisty deliveries and are scheduled in a predetermined pattern each cycle. Upon completion of delivered and breakout volumes Line 4 is shutdown ex Edmonton.    At Kerrobert, heavy volumes from Plains and Inter Pipeline are injected over Line 4. Available deliveries to Plains are scheduled simultaneous with injections.    At Stoney Beach heavy crude side stream deliveries are made to Gibsons.  At Regina deliveries of heavy crude oil batches to Consumers Co-op and Wascana Pipeline are available from Line 4.  To the extent possible, heavy injections are scheduled to occur simultaneously with scheduled deliveries.   At Clearbrook Line 4 volumes are delivered to Minnesota Pipeline.  During these deliveries U.S. medium and volumes coming from Line 65 via Clearbrook tankage may be injected.  If required, quality trains of U.S. sweet and/or some sweet, light sour or high sour batches coming from Line 2B via Clearbrook tankage may also be injected. Line 4 cannot deliver to Clearbrook tankage.  At Superior Line 4 incoming volumes access breakout tankage. Line 4 volumes are scheduled to re-pump over Lines 6, 14 or 61 or as tank transfer deliveries to Murphy.  Line 67 (Hardisty to Superior)  Line 67 originates at Hardisty and can pump heavy, heavy high tan, heavy low resid or cracked material to Clearbrook or Superior. It can also pump Edmonton heavies should they deliver to Enbridge Hardisty Contract Terminal or Enbridge Mainline tankage.  At Clearbrook Line 67 volumes can be delivered to Minnesota Pipeline. Line 67 cannot deliver to Clearbrook tankage.  At Superior Line 67 incoming volumes access breakout tankage. Line 67 volumes are scheduled to re-pump over Lines 6, 14 or 61 or as tank transfer deliveries to Murphy.  Line 65 (Cromer to Clearbrook)  Line 65 transports medium and light sour crude from Cromer to Clearbrook.  All volumes that are not delivered to Minnesota Pipeline, access breakout tankage and can be reinjected on Lines 3, 4 or 2B for shipment to Superior.     Enbridge Service Levels   Page 7      Downstream of Superior Pipelines  Line 5 (Superior to Sarnia)  Line 5 transports condensate, light synthetic, sweet, light sour and NGL volumes destined for Sarnia and east of Sarnia delivery points.  When possible, compatible batches are scheduled to pump adjacent to one another.  At Rapid River scheduled NGL volumes are side-stream delivered for stripping of their required components.  Concurrent with the side stream deliveries are side stream injections of stripped NGL.  At Lewiston scheduled U.S. sweet volumes are injected.  After the scheduled deliveries have been made at Marysville and Sarnia area refineries the balance of the Line 5 incoming volumes access breakout tankage at Sarnia for subsequent movement on Line 7.  When necessary, Line 5 and Line 6B delivery conflicts at Sarnia are directed to Enbridge tankage prior to being delivered directly to the refinery.  Line 61 (Superior to Flanagan)  Line 61 can transport all approved mainline commodities except NGL, refined products and cracked material.  At Flanagan all volumes access breakout tankage and are either reinjected on the Line 55 contract pipeline for movement to Cushing, Oklahoma or are reinjected on Line 62 for movement to Griffith/Hartsdale.   Line 62 (Flanagan to Griffith/Hartsdale)   Line 62 can transport heavy crude from Flanagan breakout tankage to Griffith / Hartsdale terminal. Volumes destined for delivery beyond Griffith/Hartsdale access breakout tankage for subsequent reinjection on Line 6B.  Volumes can also access the BP Whiting refinery utilizing Griffith/Hartsdale delivery tankage.  Line 6 (Superior to Sarnia)  Line 6 transports volumes of heavy, heavy high tan and heavy low resid crudes for delivery in the Chicago area and those destined for delivery at Sarnia / Toronto / Buffalo area refineries.  Quality trains of light synthetic and medium destined to Mustang Pipeline are also scheduled on Line 6 because it is the only line connected to Lockport terminal.    Enbridge Service Levels   Page 8      Line 6A (Superior to Griffith/Hartsdale)  The pipeline segment from Superior to Griffith/Hartsdale is referred to as Line 6A.  In the Chicago area, deliveries can be made at Lockport, Mokena and Griffith.  Volumes delivered at Lockport can be pumped over Mustang Pipeline for subsequent movement from Lockport to Patoka.  Volumes destined for delivery beyond the Chicago area access breakout tankage at Griffith/Hartsdale and are scheduled to pump ex Griffith.  Deliveries destined for BP Whiting utilize Griffith/Hartsdale delivery tankage for subsequent transfers to the refinery.  Line 6B (Griffith/Hartsdale to Sarnia)  The pipeline segment from Griffith/Hartsdale to Sarnia is referred to as Line 6B.  At Stockbridge volumes destined for Samaria and Toledo access breakout tankage for subsequent movement over Line 17.  Scheduled Line 6B deliveries occur at Marysville and the Sarnia area refineries.  The remaining Line 6B volumes destined for delivery east of Sarnia access breakout tankage at Sarnia for subsequent movement over Line 7 to connecting lines through Westover Terminal. When necessary, Line 6B and Line 5 delivery conflicts at Sarnia are directed to Enbridge tankage prior to being delivered directly to the refinery.  Line 14/64 (Superior to Griffith/Hartsdale)  Line 14/64 transports volumes ranging between condensate and medium crudes for delivery at Mokena and Griffith respectively. It is also possible for volumes transported on Line 64 to access breakout tankage at Griffith/Hartsdale for subsequent movement on Line 6B.    Even though the summary provided in Table 2 of this document (Commodity Routing Summary by Pipeline Segment) allows heavier commodities into Line 14/64, in normal operations it is considered a light crude oil line.  Line 17 (Stockbridge to Toledo)  Line 17 transports volumes of light sour, high sour, medium, heavy, heavy high tan, heavy low resid crude for delivery at Samaria and Toledo.    Line 7 (Sarnia to Westover) Line 10 (Westover to Kiantone) Line 11 (Westover to Nanticoke)  Volumes pumped over Line 7 access breakout tankage at Westover.  These volumes are subsequently rescheduled to pump over Line 10 for delivery to United Refining at Kiantone and Line 11 for delivery to Imperial Oil at Nanticoke.  Enbridge Service Levels   Page 9      F. Predicted Pipeline Transit Times (Table 3)  Predicted transit times associated with service offered by Enbridge are provided on the Oil Movement Manager / Shipper Information System (OM2/SIS) Portal.  Proxy transit times are updated weekly, and are based on original Notices of Shipment (NOS) and Revised Notices of Shipment.  Table 3 provides instructions for using the OM2/SIS Transit Time Calculator.  G. Minimum Batch Size (Table 4)  The nominal batch size in the Enbridge system is 10,000 m3 and is subject to nominations on each pipeline and feeder pipeline requests.  Batch sizes are generally a function of the volume nominated, as well as the size and number of available receipt, break-out and delivery tanks for given commodities (both within the Enbridge Mainline System and with connected feeder pipelines and refineries).   Minimum Batch Size  A shipper’s minimum monthly nomination volume, for any commodity, is typically restricted to the minimum batch sizes defined in Table 4.  This table sets out batch size considerations for the base Service Levels.  Minimum batch sizes are set based on the requirements of measurement, quality, tank utilization, capacity impact, pipeline integrity and administrative efficiency. The minimum batch size for movement on the Enbridge Mainline System is determined by the size indicated for the pipeline of delivery.  Maximum Batch Size  Maximum batch sizes are generally determined by terminal tankage availability or other operational considerations.  Currently 12,000 m³ is the largest typical batch size transported on the system; however larger batch sizes or double-batching of commodities can be reviewed by Enbridge on an individual basis with consideration to system and shipper constraints.    Enbridge and Shippers must ensure that nominated volumes can be divided into standard batch sizes within the minimum and maximum batch size parameters.  Batch sizes may also be impacted by cycle sizes on each line to maintain overall system quality guidelines.     H. Tankage Operations and Utilization by Commodity Category (Table 5)  Receipt, breakout and delivery tankage is required for the transportation of specific commodities on the Enbridge System.  Table 5 outlines the commodities that utilize tankage at various terminal locations associated with the base Service Levels.  The  Enbridge Service Levels   Page 10     tankage allocation in Table 5 is predicated on factors including but not limited to preserving the petroleum quality of batches transported on the Enbridge system. To the greatest extent possible, Enbridge will advise shippers prior to making any significant changes to tank utilization.  Actual time in tankage at each location will be dependent upon commodity allocations to each tank, system operating conditions and/or third party operations.  As a result, tankage retention times at individual locations may vary significantly as detailed in Tankage Operation.   Tankage Operation  Tanks on the Enbridge / Lakehead system are an integral part of the physical pipeline system.  There are four basic categories for tanks: receipt, breakout, delivery and operational as detailed below.  Receipt Tankage  Receipt tankage is designed to accumulate incoming volumes until such time that the volumes are scheduled to pump.  In some cases a volume or batch may pump as soon as it is received.  However at other times, especially for smaller volumes or equalized streams, volumes may be accumulated until such time that a batch is available to pump.  The Enbridge system has been historically designed such that receipt tankage is provided for a nominal retention time of 4 days. Regular operation and recent analysis indicate that retention times are moving below 4 days. Shippers and feeders should be aware of the retention times for their respective commodities.  Breakout Tankage  Breakout tankage is designed and built at locations where there is a substantial rate change, due to volumes entering or leaving the system, and may also be considered to preserve the quality of the streams. At these locations, volumes are received to breakout tankage and re-pumped on another line segment.  At breakout locations the retention time in tankage is defined as the time between landing and re-pumping batches.  The Enbridge system has been designed such that breakout tankage is provided for a nominal retention time of 2 days.    Breakout tankage is designed and built mainly to reduce power costs, pressure cycling and capital costs for new pipeline expansions. Below some examples are described where breakout tankage is required.    Line 2A volumes currently access breakout tankage at Cromer, and these volumes along with other receipts entering the system at Cromer are subsequently rescheduled on Line 2B.  Enbridge Service Levels   Page 11       At Superior there are 5 incoming pipelines and 4 outgoing pipelines, but none of the incoming rates match the outgoing rates. Therefore all volumes are required to access breakout tankage and volumes are rescheduled for subsequent movement on the various outgoing lines.  The actual time in tankage can vary from batch to batch depending on pipeline conditions with consideration given to but not limited to scheduling, petroleum quality or unplanned interruptions.  Consideration will be given to shipper requests as operational conditions allow.  Delivery Tankage  At some delivery locations the receiving refinery is not able to receive crude volumes at the full Enbridge mainline rate.  In these situations, the scheduled delivery volume will first access an Enbridge delivery tank and then be transferred over to the refinery at a lower transfer rate.  Superior and Griffith are locations where this type of operation occurs.  Operational Tankage  Tankage may be utilized for operational considerations to ""absorb"" the flow rate change from operating to shut down mode, and vice versa.   There is Mainline tankage available at Hardisty, Kerrobert, Regina, and Clearbrook that may be utilized as Operational tankage if required.  Enbridge Service Levels   Page 12     3. PROCEDURES AND REPORTING  A.  Commodity Testing (Table 6)  Enbridge conducts various standard tests for commodities transported on the pipeline system.  These standard tests are summarized for each commodity with respect to location, frequency, and type of test in Table 6, Commodity Testing Summary.  Commodity quality measurement is also provided in Table 6.  B. Shipper Services Business Activities  (Tables 7 & 8)  To manage the logistics of transporting commodities through its system, Enbridge and industry have developed a set of procedures and reporting requirements with respect to nominations, supply control and scheduling activities on its system.  These are summarized in Table 7 (Scheduling Calendar) and Table 8 (Shipper Services Business Activities).   4. COMMUNICATIONS  An important component of Enbridge service is communication to its customers.  Enbridge operations can have a material impact on oil markets and, in turn, on producers, marketers, shippers and refiners.  As such, Enbridge will strive to provide these impacted parties with timely access to system related information on its commodity movements, operational decisions and events.  Where unscheduled and unplanned events impact, or potentially impact, Enbridge operations, these will be communicated to Enbridge customers as quickly as possible, subject to any commercial considerations.  Ideally, changes to planned or scheduled events will be communicated with prior notice. Generally and where feasible, the objective will be to inform impacted parties of events or circumstances so that there are ""no surprises"" regarding system operations.  Enbridge also has a reciprocal expectation on its customers to provide accurate and timely information in order to fulfill the above noted communication obligations.

All changes submitted through OM2/SIS affecting pump orders (next 48 hours) will be promted to give proper notification to the Pipeline Schedulers as per the Line Space Queue rules.Pipeline Initially ApportionedBatch requests located in the line space queue will be honored if the pipeline, or any segment thereof, was initially apportioned, and space has become available either due to shippers reducing volumes or an increase in capacity occurs.  When either condition occurs, the first shipper in the queue will be contacted and given notification there is spare capacity and option of adding a batch.  In all cases prior to being accepted by Enbridge, the feeder pipeline must verify any extra volumes tendered.  If the total remains less than the available capacity, the volumes will be accepted.  If spare capacity still remains, the next shipper in the queue will be contacted.Pipeline At or Below CapacityIf nominations for the pipeline, or any segment thereof, indicates that space is available for the month, or in the case of a pipeline initially at capacity and space becomes available, shippers may increase volumes, on a first come basis, at any time up to the point that the increase brings that segment to capacity. Any volume increases that cannot be accommodated at this time should be submitted to our line space queue. When space becomes available on a pipeline that is initially at capacity shippers will be notified through the Oil Movement Manager/Shipper Information System (OM2/SIS) Portal that increases to nominations will be accepted.- Any changes or updates that directly affect the next 48 hours of business must be received no later than 2:00 pm MST.- Changes as a result of emergency may be accepted after 2:00 pm MST if accompanied by a direct telephone communication, and must be acknowledged by Enbridge.1.

""WTI Price"" means, with regards to any month, the NYMEX calendar month average settlement price for West Texas Intermediate for that month in barrels multiplied by 6.289811 barrels per cubic metre.   COMMODITY CLASSIFICATION AND COMMODITY TRANSMISSION SURCHARGES  Commodities shall be classified on the basis of the density and viscosity in effect at the time of receipt by the Carrier and assessed a charge including the appropriate surcharge listed below. Density shall be based on 15°C. Viscosity shall be based on the Carrier's reference line temperature at the time of receipt. Where the density of a commodity falls within the density range of one commodity classification and the viscosity of the commodity falls within the viscosity range of another commodity classification, then the commodity shall be deemed to be in the commodity classification with the higher transmission surcharge. Transmission surcharges shall be calculated as a percentage of the light petroleum transmission charge.  LIGHT PETROLEUM - A commodity having a density from 800 kilograms per cubic metre (kg/m3) up to but not including 876 kg/m3 and a viscosity from 2 square millimetres per second (mm2/s) up to but not including 20 mm2/s will be classified as Light Petroleum.  MEDIUM PETROLEUM - A commodity having a density from 876 kg/m3 up to but not including 904 kg/m3 and a viscosity from 20 mm2/s up to but not including 100 mm2/s will be classified as Medium Petroleum. Medium Petroleum is assessed the light crude transmission charge plus a surcharge of 8%, which is included in the table of Medium Crude Petroleum Transmission and Terminalling Tolls below.  HEAVY PETROLEUM - A commodity having a density from 904 kg/m3 to 940 kg/m3 inclusive and a viscosity from 100 up to and including 350 mm2/s will be classified as Heavy Petroleum. Heavy Petroleum is assessed the light crude transmission charge plus a surcharge of 22%, which is included in the table of Heavy Crude Petroleum Transmission and Terminalling Tolls below.  CONDENSATES - A commodity having a density from 600 kg/m3 up to but not including 800 kg/m3 and a viscosity of 0.4 mm2/s up to but not including 2 mm2/s will be classified as Condensates. Condensates are assessed the light crude transmission charge less a surcharge of 8%, which is included in the table of Condensates Transmission and Terminalling Tolls below.  NGL - A commodity having a maximum absolute vapour pressure of 1250 kilopascals at 37.8°C and a density of up to but not including 600 kg/m3 and a viscosity of up to but not including 0.4 mm2/s will be classified as NGL.

COMMODITY CLASSIFICATION AND COMMODITY TRANSMISSION SURCHARGES  Commodities shall be classified on the basis of the density and viscosity in effect at the time of receipt by the Carrier and assessed a charge including the appropriate surcharge listed below. Density shall be based on 15°C. Viscosity shall be based on the Carrier's reference line temperature at the time of receipt. Where the density of a commodity falls within the density range of one commodity classification and the viscosity of the commodity falls within the viscosity range of another commodity classification, then the commodity shall be deemed to be in the commodity classification with the higher transmission surcharge. Transmission surcharges shall be calculated as a percentage of the light petroleum transmission charge.  LIGHT PETROLEUM - A commodity having a density from 800 kilograms per cubic metre (kg/m3) up to but not including 876 kg/m3 and a viscosity from 2 square millimetres per second (mm2/s) up to but not including 20 mm2/s will be classified as Light Petroleum.

COMMODITY CLASSIFICATION AND COMMODITY TRANSMISSION SURCHARGES  Commodities shall be classified on the basis of the density and viscosity in effect at the time of receipt by the Carrier and assessed a charge including the appropriate surcharge listed below. Density shall be based on 15°C. Viscosity shall be based on the Carrier's reference line temperature at the time of receipt. Where the density of a commodity falls within the density range of one commodity classification and the viscosity of the commodity falls within the viscosity range of another commodity classification, then the commodity shall be deemed to be in the commodity classification with the higher transmission surcharge. Transmission surcharges shall be calculated as a percentage of the light petroleum transmission charge.  LIGHT PETROLEUM - A commodity having a density from 800 kilograms per cubic metre (kg/m3) up to but not including 876 kg/m3 and a viscosity from 2 square millimetres per second (mm2/s) up to but not including 20 mm2/s will be classified as Light Petroleum.  MEDIUM PETROLEUM - A commodity having a density from 876 kg/m3 up to but not including 904 kg/m3 and a viscosity from 20 mm2/s up to but not including 100 mm2/s will be classified as Medium Petroleum. Medium Petroleum is assessed the light crude transmission charge plus a surcharge of 8%, which is included in the table of Medium Crude Petroleum Transmission and Terminalling Tolls below.  HEAVY PETROLEUM - A commodity having a density from 904 kg/m3 to 940 kg/m3 inclusive and a viscosity from 100 up to and including 350 mm2/s will be classified as Heavy Petroleum. Heavy Petroleum is assessed the light crude transmission charge plus a surcharge of 22%, which is included in the table of Heavy Crude Petroleum Transmission and Terminalling Tolls below.  CONDENSATES - A commodity having a density from 600 kg/m3 up to but not including 800 kg/m3 and a viscosity of 0.4 mm2/s up to but not including 2 mm2/s will be classified as Condensates. Condensates are assessed the light crude transmission charge less a surcharge of 8%, which is included in the table of Condensates Transmission and Terminalling Tolls below.  NGL - A commodity having a maximum absolute vapour pressure of 1250 kilopascals at 37.8°C and a density of up to but not including 600 kg/m3 and a viscosity of up to but not including 0.4 mm2/s will be classified as NGL. NGL is assessed the light crude transmission charge less a surcharge of 10%, which is included in the table of Natural Gas Liquids Transmission and Terminalling Tolls below.
